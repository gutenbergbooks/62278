<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br /><br />
BILLY WILSON'S STRATEGY
</h3>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson lit the coal-oil lamp and placed it in the
center of the kitchen table; then she turned toward the
door, her head half bent in a listening attitude.
</p>

<p>
A brown water-spaniel waddled from the woodshed into
the room, four bright-eyed puppies at her heels, and stood
half in the glow, half in the shadow, short tail
ingratiatingly awag.
</p>

<p>
"Scoot you!" commanded the woman, and with a wild
scurry mother dog and puppies turned and fled to the
friendly darkness of their retreat.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson stood with frowning gaze fastened on the
door.  She was a tall, angular woman of some forty years,
heavy of features, as she was when occasion demanded it,
heavy of hand.  Tiny fret-lines marred a face which under
less trying conditions of life might have been winsome,
but tonight the lips of the generous mouth were tightly
compressed and the rise and fall of the bosom beneath
the low cut flannel gown hinted of a volcano that would
ere long erupt to the confusion of somebody.
</p>

<p>
As a quick step sounded outside, she lowered herself
slowly to a high-backed chair and waited, hands locked
closely upon her lap.
</p>

<p>
The door opened and her husband entered.  He cast a
quick, apprehensive glance at his wife, and the low whistle
died on his lips as he passed over to the long roller towel
hanging above the wash-bench and proceeded to dry his
hands.
</p>

<p>
He was a medium sized man, with brown wavy hair and
a beard which failed to conceal the glad boyishness of a
face that would never quite be old.  The eyes he turned
upon the woman when she sharply spoke his name were
blue and tranquil.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Mary?" he responded gently.
</p>

<p>
"I want'a tell you that I'm tired of bein' the slave
of you an' your son," she burst out.  "One of these days
I'll be packin' up and goin' to my home folks in Nova
Scotia."
</p>

<p>
Wilson averted his face and proceeded to straighten the
towel on the roller.  His action seemed to infuriate the
woman.
</p>

<p>
Her lips tightened.  Her hands unclenched and gripped
the table as she slowly arose.
</p>

<p>
"You&mdash;" she commenced, her voice tense with passion,
"you&mdash;" she checked herself.  Unconsciously one of
the groping hands had come in contact with the soft leather
cover of a book which lay on the table.
</p>

<p>
It was the family Bible.  She had placed it there after
reading her son Anson his evening chapter.  Slowly she
mastered herself and sank back into her chair.
</p>

<p>
Wilson came over and laid a work-hardened hand gently
on her heaving shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Mary," he said, "what is it?  What have I done?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh," she cried miserably, "what haven't you done,
Tom Wilson?  Didn't you bring me here to this lonesome
spot when I was happy with my son, happy an'
contented?"
</p>

<p>
"But I told you you'd like find it some lonesome, Mary,
you remember?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but did you so much as hint at what awful things
I'd have to live through here?  Not you!  Did you tell
me that an old miser 'ud die and his ghost ha'nt this
neighborhood?  Did you tell me that blindness 'ud strike
one of the best and most useful young men low?  Did you
tell me," she ran wildly on, "that the sweetest girl in the
world 'ud be dyin' of a heartbreak?  Did you tell me
anythin', Tom Wilson, that a woman who was leavin' her
own home folks, to work for you and your son, should a'
been told?"
</p>

<p>
Wilson sighed.  "How was I to know these things would
happen, Mary?  It's been hard haulin', I know, but someday
it won't be so hard.  Maybe now, you'd find it easier
if you didn't shoulder everybody else's trouble, like you
do&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Shut right up!" she flared, "I'm a Christian woman,
Tom Wilson.  Do you think I could face God on my knees
if I failed in my duty to the sick as calls fer me?  Why,
I couldn't sleep if I didn't do what little I'm able to do
fer them in trial; I'd hear weak voices acallin' me, I'd
see pain-wild eyes watchin' fer me to come an' help their
first-born into the world."
</p>

<p>
"But, Mary, there's a doctor at Bridgetown now and&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Doctors!" she cried scornfully.  "Little enough they
know the needs of a woman at such a time.  A doctor may
be all right in his place, but his place ain't here among
us woods folk.  I tell you now I know my duty an' I'll
do it because they need me."
</p>

<p>
"We all need you, Mary," spoke her husband quickly.
"Didn't I tell you that when I persuaded you to come?
I need you; Billy needs you."
</p>

<p>
She looked up at him, tears filming the fire of anger in
her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"No," she said in low tense tones, "your son don't
need me.  I'm nuthin' to him.  Sometimes I think&mdash;I
think he cares&mdash;'cause I'm longin' fer it, I guess.  But
somehow he seems to be lookin' beyond me to someone
else."
</p>

<p>
Wilson sighed and sank into a chair.
</p>

<p>
"I guess maybe it's your fancy playin' pranks on you,
Mary," he suggested hesitatingly.  "Two years of livin'
in this lonesome spot has kinder got on your nerves."
</p>

<p>
"Nerves!" she cried indignantly, sitting bolt upright.
"Don't you 'er anybody else dare accuse me of havin'
nerves, Tom Wilson.  If I wasn't the most sensible-minded
person alive I'd be throwin' fits er goin' off into gallopin'
hysterics every hour, with the things that Willium does
to scare the life out of a body."
</p>

<p>
"What's Billy been doin' now?" asked Wilson anxiously.
</p>

<p>
She shivered.  "Nothin' out'a the ordinary.  What's
that limb allars doin' to scare the daylights clean outa me
an' the neighbors?  If you'd spend a little more of your
spare time in the house with your wife an' less in the
barn with your precious stock you wouldn't need to be
askin' what he's been adoin'.  But I'll tell you what he
did only this evenin' afore you come home from changin'
words with Cobin Keeler.
</p>

<p>
"Missus Scraff&mdash;you know what a fidgety fly-off-the-handle
she is, an' how she suffers from the asthma&mdash;well,
she'd come over an' was stayin' to supper.  I sent
that Willium out on the back ridge to gather some wild
thimble-berries fer dessert.  He comes in just as I had
the table all set, that wicked old coon he's made a pet of at
his heels an' that devil-eyed crow, Croaker, on his shoulder.
Afore I could get hold of the broom, he put the covered
pail on the table an' went out ag'in.  The coon follered
him, but that crow jumped right onto the table an' grabbed
a piece of cake.  I made a dash at him an' he flopped
to Missus Scraff's shoulder.  She was chewin' a piece of
slippery-ellum bark fer her asthma, an' when his claws
gripped her shoulder she shrieked an' like to 'a' choked
to death on it.
</p>

<p>
"It took me all of half an hour to get her quieted, an'
then I made to show her what nice berries we got from
our back ridge.  'Jest hold your apron, Mrs. Scraff, an'
I'll give you a glimpse of what we're goin' to top our
supper off with,' I says, strivin' to get the poor soul's
mind off herself.
</p>

<p>
"She held out her apron, an' I lefted the lid off the
pail and pours what's in it into her lap.
</p>

<p>
"An' what d'ye 'spose was in that pail, Tom Wilson?
Four garter snakes and a lizard; that's what your
precious son had gone out and gathered fer our dessert.  I
spilled the whole caboodle of 'em into her apron afore I
noticed, an' she give one screech an' fainted dead away.
While I was busy bringin' her around, that Willium
sneaked in an' gathered them squirmin' reptiles off the
floor.  I couldn' do more jest then than look him a promise
to settle with him later, 'cause I had my hands full as it
was.  I found a pail of berries on the table when I got
a chance to look about me, an' I ain't sayin' but that boy
got them pails mixed, but that don't excuse him none."
</p>

<p>
Wilson, striving to keep his face grave, nodded.  "That's
how it's been, I guess, Mary.  He kin no more help pickin'
up every snake and animal he comes across then he kin
help breathin'.  But he don't mean any harm, Billy don't."
</p>

<p>
"That's neither here ner there," she snapped.  "He
doesn't seem to care what harm he does.  An' the hard
part of it is," she burst out, "I can't take no pleasure in
whalin' him same as I might if I was his real mother; I
jest can't, that's all.  He has a way of lookin' at me out'a
them big, grey eyes of his'n&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The voice choked up and a tear splashed down on the
hand clenched on her lap.
</p>

<p>
Comfortingly her husband's hand covered it from sight,
as though he sought to achieve by this small token of
understanding that which he could not hope to achieve
by mere words.
</p>

<p>
She caught her breath quickly and a flush stole up
beneath the sun and wind stain on her cheeks.  There was
that in the pressure of the hand on hers, strong yet tender,
which swept the feeling of loneliness from her heart.
</p>

<p>
"Mary," said the man, "I guess neither of us understand
Billy and maybe we never will, quite.  I've often
tried to tell you how much your willin'ness to face this
life here meant to him and me but I'm no good at that
sort'a thing.  I just hoped you'd understan', that's all."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm goin' to do my duty by you both, allars,"
Mrs. Wilson spoke in matter-of-fact tones, as she reached
for her sewing-basket.  "When I feel you need checkin'
up, Tom Wilson, checked you're goin' to be, an' when
Willium needs a hidin' he's goin' to get a hidin'.  An',"
she added, as her husband got up from his chair, saying
something about having to turn the horses out to pasture,
"you needn't try to side-track me from my duty neither."
</p>

<p>
"All right, Mary," he agreed, his hand on the door-latch.
</p>

<p>
"An' if you're agoin' out to the barn do try'nd not
carry any more of the barn-yard in on your big feet than
you kin help.  I jest finished moppin' the floors."
</p>

<p>
Wilson stepped out into the spicy summer darkness and
went slowly down the path to the barn.  As far as eye
could reach, through the partially cleared forest, tiny
clearing fires glowed up through the darkness, seeming to
vie with big low hanging stars.  The pungent smoke of
burning log and sward mingled pleasantly with the scent
of fern and wild blossoms.
</p>

<p>
Wilson lit his pipe and with arms folded on the top
rail of the barnyard fence gazed down across the partially-cleared,
fire-dotted sweep to where, a mile distant, a long,
densely timbered point of land stood darkly silhouetted
against the sheen of a rising moon.
</p>

<p>
From the bay-waters came the lonely cry of a loon, from
the marshes the booming of night-basking bullfrogs.  The
hoot of the owl sounded faintly from the forest beyond;
the yap of a foraging fox drifted through the night's
stillness from the uplands.
</p>

<p>
A long time Wilson stood pondering.  When at length
he bestirred himself a full moon swam above a transfigured
world.  A silvery sheen swept softly the open
spaces; through the trees the white bay-waters shimmered;
the clearing fires had receded to mere sparks with silvery
smoke trails stretching straight up towards a starred
infinity.
</p>

<p>
He sighed and turned to glance back at the cottage
resting in the hardwood grove.  It looked very homey, very
restful to him, beneath its vines of clustering wild-grape
and honeysuckle.  It was home&mdash;home it must be always.
And Mary loved it just as he loved it; this he knew.  She
was a fine woman, a great helpmate, a wonderful wife
and mother.  She was fair minded too.  She loved Billy
quite as much as she loved her own son, Anson.  Billy must
be more careful, more thoughtful of her comfort.  He would
have a heart to heart talk with his son, he told himself as
he went on to the barn.
</p>

<p>
He completed his chores and went thoughtfully back
up the flower-edged path to the house.  "There's one good
thing about Mary's crossness," he reflected, "it don't last
long.  She'll be her old cheerful self ag'in by now."
</p>

<p>
But Mrs. Wilson was not her old cheerful self; far from
it.  Wilson realized this fact as soon as he opened the
door.  She raised stern eyes to her husband as he entered.
</p>

<p>
"You see them?" she asked with sinister calmness,
pointing to a patched and clay-stained pair of trousers
on the floor beside her chair.  "Them's Willium's.  He's
jest gone to bed an' I ordered him to throw 'em down to
be patched."
</p>

<p>
Wilson nodded, "Yes, Mary?"
</p>

<p>
"And do you see this here object that I'm holdin' up
afore your dotin' father's eyes?"
</p>

<p>
He came forward and took the object from her hand.
</p>

<p>
"It also belongs to your dear, gentle son," she grated,
"leastwise I found it in one of his pants pockets."
</p>

<p>
Wilson whistled softly.  "You don't say!" he managed
to articulate.  "Why, Mary, it's a pipe!"
</p>

<p>
"Is it?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, a corn-cob pipe," he repeated weakly.
</p>

<p>
"Is it re'lly?" she returned with sarcasm.  "I wasn't
sure.  I thort maybe it was a fish-line, or a jack-knife.
Now what do you think of your precious son?" she
demanded.
</p>

<p>
Wilson shook his head.  "It's a new pipe," he ventured
to say, "and," sniffing the bowl, "it ain't had nuthin'
more deadly than dried mullen leaves in it so far.  Ain't
a great deal of harm in a boy smokin' mullen leaves,
shorely, Mary."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, is that so?  Haven't I heered you an' Cobin Keeler
say, time and ag'in, that that's how you both got the
smoke-habit?  And look at you old chimbneys now; the
pipe's never out'a your mouths."
</p>

<p>
"I'll talk things over with Billy in the mornin',"
promised Wilson as he took the boot-jack from its peg.
</p>

<p>
"A pile of good your talkin''ll do," she cried.  "I'm
goin' to talk things over with that boy with a hickory
ram-rod, jest as soon as I feel he's proper asleep; that's
what I'm goin' to do!  Who's trainin' that boy, you er
me?" she demanded.
</p>

<p>
"You, of course, Mary."
</p>

<p>
"Well then, you best let me be.  What I feel he should
get, he's goin' to get, and get right.  You keep out'a this,
Tom Wilson, if you want me to keep on; that's all."
</p>

<p>
"It don't seem right to wake boys up just to give 'em
a whalin', Mary," he protested.  "My Ma used to wake
me up sometimes, but never to whale me.  I'd rather
remember&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Shut up!  I tell yun, I'm goin' to give him the hickory
this night or I'm goin' to know the reason why.  I'll break
that boy of his bad habits er I'll break my arm tryin'.
You let me be!"
</p>

<p>
"I'm not findin' fault with your methods of trainin'
boys, Mary," her husband hastened to say.  "You're doin'
your best by Billy, I know that right well.  And Billy is
rather a tough stick of first-growth timber to whittle
smooth and straight, I know that, too.  But the gnarliest
hickory makes the best axe-handle, so maybe he'll make a
good man some day, with your help."
</p>

<p>
"Humph! well that bein' so, I'm goin' to help him see
the error of his ways this night if ever I did," she promised
grimly.
</p>

<p>
Something like a muffled chuckle came from behind the
stairway door, but the good woman, intent on her grievance,
did not hear it.  Wilson heard, however, and let the
boot-jack fall to the floor with a clatter.  He picked it up and
carried it over to its accustomed peg on the wall, whistling
softly the tune which he had whistled to Billy in the old
romping, astride-neck days:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Oh, you'd better be up, and away, lad.<br />
  You better be up and away!<br />
  There is danger here in the glade, lad,<br />
  It's a heap of trouble you've made, lad&mdash;<br />
  So you'd better be up and away!<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Over beside the table, Mrs. Wilson watched him from
somber eyes.
</p>

<p>
"That's right!" she sighed.  "Whistle!  It shows all
you care.  That boy could do anythin' he wanted to do an'
you wouldn't say a word; no, not a word!"
</p>

<p>
Wilson did not answer.  He was listening for the stairs
to creak, telling him that Billy had left his eaves-dropping
for the security of the loft.
</p>

<p>
Billy had heard and understood.  When his dad sent
him one of those "up and away" signals he never questioned
its significance.  He didn't like listening in secret,
but surely he reasoned, a boy had a right to know just
what was coming to him.  And he knew what was coming
to him, all right&mdash;a caning from the supple hickory
ramrod&mdash;maybe!
</p>

<p>
Up in the roomy loft which he and his step-brother,
Anson, shared together, he lit the lamp.  Anson was
sleeping and Billy wondered just what he would say when he
woke up in the morning and found his pants gone.  Their
mother had demanded that a pair of pants be thrown down
to her.  Billy needed his own so he had thrown down
Anson's.
</p>

<p>
But how in the world was he ever going to get out of
that window with Anson's bed right up against it, and
Anson sleeping in the bed?  Anson would be sure to hear
the ladder when Walter Watland and Maurice Keeler raised
it against the wall.  He must get Anson up and out of
that bed!
</p>

<p>
Billy placed the lamp on a chair and reaching over shook
Anson's long, regular snore into fragments of little gasps.
He shook harder and Anson sat up, sandy hair rumpled
and pale blue eyes blinking in the light.
</p>

<p>
"What's'amatter?" he asked sleepily.
</p>

<p>
"Hush," cautioned Billy.  "Ma's downstairs wide
awake and she's awful cross.  What you been doin' to rile
her, Anse?"
</p>

<p>
Anson frowned and scratched his head.  "Did you tell
her 'bout my lettin' the pigs get in the garden when I
was tendin' gap this afternoon?" he asked suspiciously.
</p>

<p>
"No, it ain't that.  I guess maybe she's worried more'n
cross, an' she's scared too&mdash;scared stiff.  Well, who
wouldn't be with that awful thing prowlin' around ready
to claw the insides out'a people in their sleep?"
</p>

<p>
Anson sat up suddenly.
</p>

<p>
"What you talkin' 'bout, Bill?  What thing?  Who's
it been clawin'?  Hurry up, tell me."
</p>

<p>
Billy glanced at the window, poorly protected by a
cotton mosquito screen, and shivered.
</p>

<p>
"Nobody knows what it is," he whispered.  "Some say
it's a gorilla and others say it's a big lynx.  Ol' Harry's
the only one who saw it, an' he's so clawed and bit he
can't describe it to nobody."
</p>

<p>
"Great Scott!  Bill, you mean to say it got ol' Harry?"
</p>

<p>
Billy nodded.  "Yep, last night.  He was asleep when
that thing climbed in his winder an' tried to suck his
blood away."
</p>

<p>
"Ugh!"  Anson shuddered and pulled the bed clothes
up about his ears.  "How did it get it, Bill!  Does
anybody know?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, there was a tree standin' jest outside his winder
same as that tree stands outside this one.  It climbed that
tree and jumped through the mosquito nettin' plumb onto
ol' Harry.  He was able to tell the doctor that much afore
he caved under."
</p>

<p>
Anson's blue eyes were staring at the wide unprotected
window.  Outside, the moon swam hazily above the forest;
shadows like huge, misshapen monsters prowled on the
sward; weird sounds floated up and died on the still air.
</p>

<p>
"Bill," Anson's voice was shaking, "I don't feel like
sleepin' longside this winder.  That awful thing might come
shinnin' up that tree an' gulp me up.  I'm goin' down
and ask Ma if I can't sleep out in the shed with Moll an'
the pups."
</p>

<p>
Billy promptly scented a new danger to his plans.  "If
I was you I wouldn't do that, Anse," he advised.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm goin' to do it."  Anson sat up in bed and
peered onto the floor.
</p>

<p>
"Where the dickens are my pants?" he whispered.
"See anythin' of 'em, Bill?"
</p>

<p>
"Anse," Billy's voice was sympathetic.  "I see I have
to tell you everythin'.  Ma, she's goin' fo give you the
canin' of your young life, jest as soon as she thinks we're
proper asleep."
</p>

<p>
"Canin'?  Me?  Whatfer?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, seems she was up here lookin' fer somethin' a
little while ago.  She saw your pants layin' there an' she
thought maybe they needed patchin', so she took 'em down
with her."
</p>

<p>
"Well, what of it?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, nuthin', only she happened to find a pipe in one
of the pockets, that's all."
</p>

<p>
"Jerusalem!"  Anson's teeth chattered.  "Well, I'm
goin' down anyway.  I don't mind a hidin', but I'm
derned if I'm goin' to lay here and get clawed up by no
gorilla."
</p>

<p>
"Anse, listen," Billy put a detaining hand on his
brother's shoulder.  "You don't need to do that, an' you
needn't sleep in this bed neither.  I'll sleep in it, an' you
kin sleep in mine.  That gorilla, er whatever it is, can't
hurt me, cause I've got that rabbit-foot charm that Tom
Dodge give me.  I'll tie it round my neck."
</p>

<p>
Anson reflected, shuddering as a long low wail came from
the forest.
</p>

<p>
"That's the boys," Billy told himself.  "I've gotta
move fast."
</p>

<p>
Aloud he urged: "Come on, Anse.  Get Out an' pile
into my bed.  I ain't scared to sleep in yours, not a bit.
Besides," he added, "it'll save you a canin' from Ma."
</p>

<p>
"How will it, I'd like to know?"
</p>

<p>
"Why this way.  Ma'll come creepin' up here in the
dark, when she thinks we're asleep an' she'll come straight
to this&mdash;your bed.  She'll turn down the clothes an' give
me a slash or two, thinkin' it's you.  I'll let her baste me
some&mdash;then I'll speak to her.  She'll be so surprised she'll
ferget all about whalin' you.  She's that way, you know.
Like as not she'll laugh to think she basted me&mdash;an' she'll
be good-natured.  You needn't worry any about a lickin',
Anse."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'll take a chance, Bill."
</p>

<p>
Anson got out of bed, his white legs gleaming in the
yellow lamp-light as he tiptoed softly across to Billy's
cot and lay down.
</p>

<p>
Billy blew out the lamp and went through the motions
of undressing.  He removed one shoe, let it fall on the floor,
waited an interval and let the same shoe fall again.  Then
he put it back on.  By and by he lay down and gave a
long, weary sigh.  Then he held his breath and listened.
</p>

<p>
Below his window sounded a whippoorwill's call.  From
the opposite side of the room came the long, regular snores
of Anson.  Billy sat up in bed and started to remove the
tacks from the window screen.
</p>

<p>
Something fell with a thud against the wall outside, and
brushed against the boards.  A cat mewed directly beneath
the window.  Gently Billy rolled the bed quilts into an
oblong shape resembling a human form, then silently made
his way out of the window.
</p>

<p>
His feet struck the top round of a ladder.  A moment
more and he was crouching in the shadow of the wall, two
shadowy forms squatting beside him.
</p>

<p>
"All hunky?" a voice whispered in his ear.
</p>

<p>
"All hunky," Billy whispered back.
</p>

<p>
"Then come on."
</p>

<p>
But Billy plucked at the speaker's sleeve.  "Wait a
minute, Fatty," he urged.  "Anson's up there asleep, an'
he's goin' to have a wakin' nightmare in about four
seconds.  I jest heard Ma goin' up."
</p>

<p>
Silence, deep and brooding, fell.  Then suddenly from
the loft came a long wail, followed by a succession of
shorter gasps and gulps, and above the swish of a hickory
ram-rod a woman's voice exclaiming angrily.
</p>

<p>
"I'll teach you to smoke on the sly, you young outlaw,
you!"
</p>

<p>
"Now let's get while the gettin's good," whispered
Billy; and the three crept off into the shadows.
</p>

<p>
Down through the night-enshrouded woods the boys
made their way noiselessly, Billy leading, Walter Watland,
nicknamed Fatty on account of his size, close behind him
and Maurice Keeler, Billy's sworn chum and confidant,
bringing up the rear.  Occasionally a soft-winged owl
fluttered up from its kill, with a muffled "who-who."  Once
a heavy object plunged from the trail with a snort, and
the boys felt the flesh along their spines creeping.  They
kept on without so much as a word, crossing a swift creek
on a fallen tree, holding to its bank and making a detour
into the woods to avoid passing close to a dilapidated log
cabin which in the moonlight bore evidence of having
fallen into disuse.  As they skirted the heavy thicket of
pines, which even in the summer night's stillness sighed
low and mournfully, the leader halted suddenly and a
low exclamation fell from his lips.
</p>

<p>
"Look!" he whispered.  "Look!  There's a light in
the ha'nted house."
</p>

<p>
His companions crept forward and peered through the
trees.  Sure enough from the one unglazed window of the
old building came the twinkle of a light, which bobbed
about in weird, uncertain fashion.
</p>

<p>
"Old Scroggie's ghost huntin' fer the lost money,"
whispered Walter, "Oh, gosh! let's leg it!'
</p>

<p>
"Leg nuthin'!" Billy removed his hand from his
trousers-pocket and waved something before two pairs of
fear-widened eyes.
</p>

<p>
"'No ghost kin harm where lies this charm,'" he recited
solemnly.  "Now if you fellers feel like beatin' it, why
beat it; but so long as I'm grabbin' onto this left hind
foot of a graveyard rabbit I don't run away from no
ghost&mdash;not even old man Scroggie's."
</p>

<p>
"That's all right fer you, Bill," returned Walter, "but
what's goin' t' happen t' Maurice an' me, supposin' that
ghost takes a notion to gallop this way?  That's what I
want'a know!"
</p>

<p>
Billy turned upon him.  "Say, Fatty, haven't I told
you that this here charm protects everybody with me?"
he asked cuttingly.
</p>

<p>
"There's never been a ghost that ever roamed nights
been able to get near it.  You kin ask Tom Dodge er any
of the other Injuns if there has."
</p>

<p>
"Oh it might lay an Injun ghost," said the unreasonable
Fatty, "but how about a white man's?  How about
old man Scroggie's, fer instance?  You know yourself,
Bill, old man Scroggie was a tartar.  Nobody ever fooled
him while he was alive an' nobody need try now he's dead.
If he wants to come back here an' snoop round lookin' fer
the money he buried an' forgot where, it's his own funeral.
I'm fer not mixin' up in this thing any&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Keep still!" cautioned Billy, "an' look yonder!  See
it?"
</p>

<p>
He pointed through the trees to an open glade in the
grove.  The full moon, riding high in the sky, threw her
light fair upon the fern-sown sod; across the glade a white
object was moving&mdash;drifting straight toward the watchers.
Billy, tightly gripping his rabbit's foot charm in one sweaty
hand and a rough-barked sapling in the other, felt Walter's
hands clutching his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"Oh Jerusalem!" groaned the terrified Fatty, "It's
the ghost!  Look, it's sheddin' blue grave-mist!  Fer the
love of Mike let's git out'a this!"
</p>

<p>
"Wait," gulped Billy, but it was plain to be seen he
was wavering.  His feet were getting uneasy, his toes
fairly biting holes through his socks in their eagerness
to tear up the sward.  But as leader it would never do
for him to show the white feather.
</p>

<p>
The approaching terror had drifted into the shadow
again.  Suddenly, so near that it fairly seemed to scorch
the frowsy top of the sapling to which he was hanging, a
weird blue light twisted upward almost in Billy's eyes.  At
the same moment a tiny hoot-owl, sleeping off its early
evening's feed in the cedar close beside the boys, woke up
and gave a ghostly cry.  It was too much for overstrained
nerves to stand.  Billy felt Fatty's form quiver
and leap even before his agonized howl fell on his
ears&mdash;a cry which he and Maurice may have echoed, for all he
knew.
</p>

<p>
They were fully a mile away from the place of terror
before sheer exhaustion forced them to abate their wild
speed and tumble in a heap beneath a big elm tree, along
the trail of the forest.
</p>

<p>
For a time they lay gasping and quivering.  Maurice
Keeler was the first to speak.  "Say, Bill," he shivered,
"is it light enough fer you to see if the hair is scorched
off one side o' my head?  That&mdash;that ghost's breath shot
blue flame square in my face."
</p>

<p>
"It grabbed me in its bony fingers," whispered Fatty.
"Gosh, it tore the sleeve fair out'a my shirt.  Look!"  And
to prove the truth of his statement he lifted a fat
arm to which adhered a tattered sleeve.
</p>

<p>
Billy sat up and surveyed his companions with disgust.
</p>

<p>
"A nice pair of scare-babies you two are," he said,
scathingly.  "A great pair you are to help me find old
Scroggie's will an' money.  Why, say, if you'd only kept
your nerve a little, that ghost would'a led us right to the
spot, most likely; but 'stead o' that you take to your heels
at first sight of it.  Say!  I thought you both had more
sand."
</p>

<p>
Maurice squirmed uncomfortably.  "Now look here,
Bill," he protested, "Fatty an' me wasn't any scarter
than you was, yourself.  Who made the first jump, I
want'a know; who?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, who <i>did</i>?" snapped Billy, glowering at his two
bosom friends.
</p>

<p>
"You did," Maurice affirmed.  "An' you grabbed
Fatty by the arm an' pulled his shirt sleeve out.  I saw
you.  And you can't say you didn't run neither, else how
did you get here same time as Fatty an' me?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I didn't run, but I own I <i>follered</i> you,"
compromised Billy.  "There wasn't anythin' else I could do,
was there?  How did I know what you two scared rabbits
ud do?  You might'a run plumb into Lake Erie an' got
drownded, you was so scared.  Somebody's had to keep
his head," he said airily.
</p>

<p>
"Well I kept mine by havin' a good pair of legs,"
groaned Fatty.  "I'm not denyin' that.  And by gravy,
if they had been good enough fer a thousand miles I'd've
let 'em go the limit.  Scared!  Oh yowlin' wildcats!  I'll
see ghosts an' smell brimstone the rest o' my life."
</p>

<p>
"Boys," cried Billy in awed tones.  "It's gone!"
</p>

<p>
"What's gone?" asked his companions in a breath.
</p>

<p>
Billy was feeling frantically in his pockets.  "My
rabbit foot charm," he groaned.  "I fell over a log an' it
must'a slipped out'a my pocket."
</p>

<p>
"You had it in your hand when th' ghost poked its
blue tongue in our faces," affirmed Maurice.  "I saw it."
</p>

<p>
"You throwed somethin' at the ghost afore you howled
an' run," Fatty stated.  "Maybe it was the rabbit foot?"
</p>

<p>
"'No ghost kin harm where lies this charm,'"
chuckled Maurice.
</p>

<p>
Billy turned on him.  "If you want'a make fun of a
charm, why all right, go ahead," he said coldly.  "Only
I know I wouldn't do it, not if I wanted it to save me
from a ghost, anyway."
</p>

<p>
Maurice looked frightened.  "I wasn't pokin' fun at
the charm, Bill, cross my heart, I wasn't," he said earnestly.
</p>

<p>
"All right then, see that you don't.  Now, see here, I'll
tell you somethin'.  I did throw my rabbit's foot charm
but that was to keep that ghost from follerin'.  Maybe you
two didn't hear it snort when it got to that charm an'
tried to pass it, so's to catch up to us; but I heard it.
Oh say, but wouldn't it be mad though?"
</p>

<p>
"An' that's why you throwed it," exclaimed the
admiring Maurice.  "Gosh, nobody else would'a thought
of that."
</p>

<p>
"Nobody," echoed Fatty, "nobody but Bill."
</p>

<p>
"Well, somebody has to think in a case o' that kind,"
admitted Billy, "an' think quick.  It was up to me to
save you, an' I did the only thing I could think of right
then."
</p>

<p>
Just here the whistle of bob-white sounded from a
little distance along the trail.
</p>

<p>
"That's Elgin Scraff and Tom Holt comin' to look fer
us," cried Maurice.
</p>

<p>
"Answer 'em," said Billy.
</p>

<p>
Maurice puckered up his lips and gave an answering
call.  It was returned almost immediately.  A moment
later two more boys came into the moonlight.
</p>

<p>
"We wondered what kept you fellers, so came lookin'
fer you," spoke Tom Holt as they came up.  "Thought
you'd be comin' by the tamarack swamp trail, an' we stuck
around there fer quite a while, waitin'.  Then Elgin said
maybe you had come the ha'nted house way, so we struck
through the bush an' tried to pick up your trail.  Once
we thought we saw the ghost, but it turned out to be old
Ringold's white yearlin' steer.  It had rubbed up ag'inst
some will-o-the-wisp fungus an' it fair showered sparks
of blue fire.  If we hadn't heered it bawlin' we'd have
run sure."
</p>

<p>
Somewhere behind him Billy heard a giggle, which was
immediately suppressed as he turned and looked over his
shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Yep," he replied, "we saw that steer, too.  We've
been waitin' here, hopin' we'd hear your whistle.  I
wonder what time it's gettin' to be?"
</p>

<p>
Tom Holt, the proud possessor of a watch, consulted it.
"Ten twelve an' a half," he answered, holding the dial
to the moon-light.  "Sandtown'll be sound asleep.  Come
on, let's go down to the lake an' make a haul."
</p>

<p>
"I s'pose we might be goin'," said Billy.  "All right,
fellers, come along."
</p>

<p>
Arriving at the lake the boys learned after careful
reconnoitering that everything was clear for immediate
action.  Not a light glimmered from the homes of the
fishermen, to show that they were awake and vigilant.
</p>

<p>
The white-fish run was on and when the boys, launching
the big flat-bottomed fish boat, carefully cast and drew
in the long seine it held more great gleaming fish than
they knew how to dispose of.
</p>

<p>
"Only one thing to do," reasoned Billy, "take what
we want an' let the rest go."
</p>

<p>
And this they did.  When they left the beach the moon
was low above the Point pines, the draw-seine was back in
its place on the big reel and there was nothing to show
the lake fishermen that the Scotia Fish Supply Company
had been operating on their grounds.

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br /><br />
A SHOWER OF FISH
</h3>

<p>
Between the fishermen of Sandtown and the farmers of
the community existed no very strong bond of sympathy
or friendship.  The former were a dissolute, shiftless lot,
quite content, with draw-seine and pound-net, to eke out
a miserable existence in the easiest manner possible.  They
were tolerated just as the poor and shiftless of any
community are tolerated; their children were allowed to
attend the school the same as the children of the
tax-payers.
</p>

<p>
Each spring the farmers attended the fishermen's annual
bee of pile-driving, which meant the placing of the stakes
for the pound nets&mdash;a dangerous and thankless task.  Wet,
weary and hungry, they would return to their homes at
night with considerable more faith in the reward that
comes of helping one's fellow-men than in the promise of
the fishermen to keep them supplied, gratis, with all the
fresh fish they needed during the season.
</p>

<p>
As far back as any of the farmers could remember the
fishermen had made that promise and in no case had it
been fulfilled.  So they came, in time, to treat it as a
joke.  Nevertheless, they were always on hand to help with
the pile-driving.  They were an old-fashioned,
simple-hearted people, content with following the teachings of
their good Book&mdash;"Cast thy bread upon the waters, for
thou shalt find it after many days."
</p>

<p>
And find it they did, ultimately, in a mysterious and
unexpected way.  One late June morning each of the
farmers who had for season after season toiled with those
fishermen without faintest hope of earthly reward awoke
to find a mess of fresh lake fish hanging just outside their
respective doors.  It was a great and wonderful revelation.
The circuit minister, Rev. Mr. Reddick, whose love for and
trust in his fellow-men was all-embracing, wept when the
intelligence was imparted to him, and took for his text on
the Sunday following a passage of scripture dealing with
the true reward of unselfish serving.  It was a stirring
sermon, the rebuke of a father to his children who had
erred.
</p>

<p>
"Oh ye of little faith," he concluded, "let this be
a lesson to you; and those of you, my brothers, whose
judgment of humanity has been warped through God-given
prosperity, get down on your knees and pray humbly
for light, remembering that <i>Christ believed in His fishermen</i>."
</p>

<p>
At the conclusion of the service, Deacon Ringold called
a few of the leading church members together and to them
spoke his mind thus:
</p>

<p>
"Brothers, you heard what our minister said, an' he's
right.  I, fer one, am ashamed of the thoughts I've thought
to'rds them fishermen of Sandtown.  I've acted mean to
'em in lots of ways, I'll admit.  An' so have you&mdash;you
can't deny it!"
</p>

<p>
The deacon, a florid, full-whiskered man of about sixty,
glowered about him.  No one present thought of disputing
his assertion.  The deacon was a power in the community.
</p>

<p>
"I tell you, brothers," he continued, waxing eloquent,
"the old devil is pretty smooth and he'll get inside the
guard of Christianity every time unless we keep him
barred by acts of Christly example.  I have been
downright contemptuous to them poor sand folks; I have so!
Time and ag'in I've refused 'em even the apples rottin'
on the ground in my orchard.  Now, I tell you what I'm
goin' to do.  I'm goin' to load up my wagon with such
fruit an' vegetables as they never get a smell of, an' I'm
goin' to drive down there and distribute it among 'em.
I ain't suggestin' that you men do likewise&mdash;that's
between you and your conscience&mdash;but," he added,
glaring about him, "I'd like to know if any of you has any
suggestions to make."
</p>

<p>
A tall, sad-visaged man rose slowly from his seat and
took a few steps up the aisle.  Like the others he was full
bearded; like them his hands bore the calluses of honest
toil.
</p>

<p>
"Fisherman Shipley wanted to buy a cow from me on
time," he said.  "I refused him.  If you don't mind,
Deacon, I'll lead her down behind your wagon tomorrow."
</p>

<p>
Ringold nodded approval.  "All right, Neighbor
Watland.  Anybody else got anythin' to say?"
</p>

<p>
A short, heavy set man stirred in his seat, and spoke
without rising.  "I'm only a poor workin'-man, without
anythin' to give but the strength of my arm, but I'm willin'
to go down and help them fishermen build their smoke-houses.
I'm a pretty good carpenter, as you men know."
</p>

<p>
"That you are, Jim," agreed the deacon heartily.
"We'll tell 'em that Jim Glover'll be down to give 'em
a hand soon."
</p>

<p>
One by one others got up and made their little offers.
Cobin Keeler, a giant in stature, combed his flowing beard
with his fingers and announced he'd bring along a load
of green corn-fodder.  Gamp Stevens promised three bags
of potatoes.  Joe Scraff, a little man with a thin voice, said
he had some lumber that the fishermen might as well be
using for their smoke-houses.  Each of the others present
offered to do his part, and then the men separated for
their several homes.
</p>

<p>
"Understand, brothers," the deacon admonished as they
parted, "we must be careful not to let them poor, ignorant
people think we're doin' this little act of Christianity
because they've seen fit to fulfill their promise to us
regardin' fish.  That would spoil the spirit of our givin'.
Let not one man among us so much as mention fish.
Brotherly kindness, Christian example.  That's our motto,
brothers, and we'll foller it."
</p>

<p>
"You're right, Deacon," spoke Cobin Keeler.
</p>

<p>
"He's always right," commented Scraff, who owed the
deacon a couple of hundred dollars.  "An'," he added,
"while we're hangin' strictly to Bible teachin', might it
not be a good idea fer us not to let our left hand know
what our right hand's doin'?"
</p>

<p>
"Meanin' outsiders?" questioned Keeler.
</p>

<p>
"Outsiders and insiders as well; our wives fer instance."  Scraff
had a mental vision of a certain woman objecting
strenuously to the part he hoped personally to play in the
giving.
</p>

<p>
"Humph," said the deacon, "Joe Scraff may be right
at that.  Maybe it would be just as well if we kept our
own counsel in this matter, brothers.  Tomorrow mornin',
early, let each of us prepare his offerin' and depart fer
the lake.  We'll meet there and make what distribution
of our gifts as seems fair to them cheats&mdash;I mean them
poor misguided fishermen," he corrected hurriedly.
</p>

<p>
And so they parted with this understanding.  And when
their footsteps had died away, a small, dusty boy crawled
out from under the penitent bench, slipped like a shadow
to a window, opened it and dropped outside.
</p>

<p>
By mid-afternoon Billy Wilson's boon companions had
learned from him that a good-will offering was to be made
the fishermen of Sandtown by the people of Scotia.  It
was a terrible disgrace&mdash;a dangerous state of affairs.  The
hated Sand-sharkers merited nothing and should receive
nothing, if Billy and his friends could help it.  Immediate
action was necessary if the plan of the farmers was to be
frustrated and the outlaw fishermen kept in their proper
place.  So Billy and his friends held a little caucus in the
beach grove behind the school-house.  For two hours they
talked together in low tones.  Then Billy arose and crept
stealthily away through the trees.  The others silently
separated.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
Sunset was streaking the pine tops with spun gold and
edging the gorgeous fabric with crimson ribbons; the big
lake lay like an opal set in coral.  Fishermen Shipley
and Sward, seated on the bow of their old fish-boat, were
idly watching the scene when Billy Wilson approached,
hands in pockets and gravely surveyed them.
</p>

<p>
Shipley was a small, wizened man with scant beard and
hair.  He wheezed a "Hello, Sonny" at Billy, while he
packed the tobacco home in his short, black pipe with a
claw-like finger.
</p>

<p>
His companion, a tall, thin man, grinned, but said
nothing.  His red hair was long and straggly; splashes of
coal-tar besmeared him from the neckband of his greasy
shirt to the bottoms of his much-patched overalls.
</p>

<p>
"What dye you want, boy?"  Shipley's pipe was alight
now and he peered down at Billy through the pungent
smoke-wreaths.
</p>

<p>
"I was sent down here to give you a message, Mr. Shipley,"
said Billy.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what is it, then?  Who sent you?  Come now,
out with it quick, or I'll take a tarred rope-end to you."
</p>

<p>
"It was Deacon Ringold sent me," Billy answered.
"He told me to tell you that he's got to turn his pigs into
the orchard tomorrow an' that you an' the other people
here might as well come an' gather up the apples on the
ground if you want 'em."
</p>

<p>
"What!"  Shipley and Sward started so forcibly that
their heads came together with a bump.  "So the old
skinflint is goin' to give us his down apples, is he?"
wheezed Shipley.  "Well, he ain't givin' much, but we'll
come over tonight and get 'em.  It's a wonder the old
hypocrite would let us gather 'em on Sunday night, ain't
it, Benjamin?" he addressed his companion.
</p>

<p>
"He's afeerd they'll make his hogs sick most like,"
sneered Sward.
</p>

<p>
"He says, if you don't mind, to come about ten or
'leven o'clock," said Billy.
</p>

<p>
Shipley threw back his head and chuckled a wheezing
laugh.  "Loramity!  Benjamin," he choked, "can't you
get his reason fer that?  He wants to make sure that all
the prayer-meetin' folks will be gone home.  It wouldn't
do fer 'em to see us helpin' keep the deacon's pigs from
cholery.  Ain't that like the smooth old weasel, though?"
</p>

<p>
"What'll I tell Mr. Ringold?" asked Billy as he turned
to go.
</p>

<p>
"You might tell him that he's an angel if you wanter
lie to him," returned Shipley, "or that he's a canny old
skin-flint, if you wanter tell him the truth.  I reckon,
though, sonny, you best tell him that we'll be along 'tween
ten and leven.
</p>

<p>
"That's a nice lookin' youngster," remarked Sward,
as Billy was lost among the pines.  "Notice the big eyes
of him, Jack?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Oh, I daresay the boy's all right, Benjamin, but
he belongs to them Scotians and they're no friends of ourn.
I reckon I scared him some when I threatened to give
him the rope, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, he wasn't givin' no signs that you did," Sward
returned, "he seemed to me to be tryin' his best to keep
from laughin' in your face."
</p>

<p>
"By thunder! did he now?"
</p>

<p>
"Fact, Jack.  Seems to me them young Scotians don't
scare very easy.  However," sliding off the boat, "that
ain't gettin' ready for the apple gatherin'.  Let's go and
mosey up some sacks and get the others in line."
</p>

<p>
Shipley laid a claw-like hand on his friend's arm and
turned his rheumy eyes on Sward's blinking blue ones.
"Benjamin, we're goin' after the deacon's apples, <i>but we
ain't goin' to take no windfalls</i>."
</p>

<p>
"You mean we'll strip the trees, Jack?" exulted Sward.
</p>

<p>
"Exactly.  And, Benjamin, kin you imagine the old
deacon's face in the mornin' when he sees what we've
done?"  And the two cronies went off laughing over their
prospective raid.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
Sunday-night prayer meeting was just over.  The
worshippers had gone from the church in twos and threes.
Deacon Ringold had remained behind to extinguish the
church lights and lock up.  As he stepped from the porch
into the shadows along the path, a small hand gripped
his arm.
</p>

<p>
"Hello!" exclaimed the startled deacon.  "Why,
bless us, it's a boy!  Who are you, and what do you
want?"
</p>

<p>
Apparently the boy did not hear the first question.
"Mr. Ringold," he whispered, "I waited here to see
you.  The Sandtown fishermen are comin' to rob your
orchard tonight."
</p>

<p>
"What?"  The deacon gripped the boy's arm and
shook him.  "What's that you say?" he questioned
eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"I was down to the lake this evenin'," said the boy,
"an' I heard Shipley and Sward talkin' together.  They
was plannin' a raid on your orchard tonight."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Ringold fairly gasped.  "Oh, the thankless,
misguided wretches!" he exclaimed.  "And to think that
we were foolish enough to feel that we hadn't treated
'em with Christian kindness.  Did you hear 'em say what
time they was comin', boy?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes sir.  They said 'bout half-past ten."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'll be on hand to receive 'em," the deacon
promised, "and if I don't teach them thieves and rogues
a lesson it'll be a joke on me.  Now I must run on and
catch up with Cobin Keeler and the rest o' the neighbors.
They've got to know about this, so, if you'll jest tell me
your name&mdash;why, bless me, the boy's gone!"
</p>

<p>
The deacon stood perplexedly scratching his head.  Then
he started forward on a run to tell those who had planned
with him a little surprise gift for the fishermen of the
perfidy of human nature.
</p>

<p>
That night the fishermen of Sandtown were caught
red-handed, stealing Deacon Ringold's harvest apples.  Like
hungry ants scenting sugar they descended upon that
orchard, en masse, at exactly ten-thirty o'clock.  By
ten-forty they had done more damage to the hanging fruit
than a wind storm could do in an hour and at ten-forty-five
they were pounced upon by the angry deacon and his
neighbors and given the lecture of their lives.  In vain
they pleaded that it was all a mistake, that they had been
sent an invitation via a small boy, from the deacon himself.
</p>

<p>
Ringold simply growled "lying ingrates," and bade
them begone and never again to so much as dare lay a
boot-sole on his or his neighbors' property.  And so they
went, and with them went all hope of a possible drawing
together in Christian brotherhood of the two factions.
</p>

<p>
"Brothers," spoke the deacon sadly, as he and his
neighbors were about to separate, "I doubt if we have
displayed the proper Christian spirit, but even a
Christian must protect his property.  Oh, why didn't some
small voice whisper to them poor misguided people and
warn 'em to be patient and all would be well."
</p>

<p>
"It means, o' course, that we'll get no more fish,"
spoke up the practical Scraff.
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes you will," spoke a voice, seemingly above their
heads.
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes you will," echoed another voice on the left,
and on the right still another voice chanted.  "You will,
you will."
</p>

<p>
"Mercies on us!" cried the amazed deacon, clutching
the fence for support.  "Whose voice was that?  You
heard it, men.  Whose was it?"
</p>

<p>
The others stood, awed, frightened.
</p>

<p>
"There was three voices," whispered Scraff.  "They
seemed to be scattered among the trees.  It's black magic,
that's what it is&mdash;or old Scroggie's ghost," he finished
with a shudder.
</p>

<p>
"Joe, I'm ashamed of you," chided the white-faced
deacon.  "Come along to my house, all of you, and I'll
have wife make us a strong cup of tea."
</p>

<p>
They passed on, and then from the sable-hued cedars
bordering the orchard four small figures stole and moved
softly away.
</p>

<p>
Once safely out on the road they paused to look back.
</p>

<p>
"Boys," whispered Billy, "she worked fine.  Them
Sand-sharkers are goin' to stay where they belong.  An',
fellers, seein' as we've promised fish, fish it's gotta
be."  And so was formed the Scotia Fish Supply Company.
</p>

<p>
Four shadowy forms drifted apart and were lost in
deeper shadows.  The golden moon rode peacefully in the
summer sky.

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br /><br />
APPRAISING THE NEW TEACHER
</h3>

<p>
The morning wood-mists were warm, sweet-scented; the
wood-birds' song of thanksgiving was glad with the essence
of God-given life.  But the man astride the dejected and
weary horse saw none of the beauties of his surroundings,
heard none of the harmony, experienced none of the
exhilaration of the life all about him, as he rode slowly
down the winding trail between the trees.  He sat erect
in his saddle, eyes fixed straight before him.  His face
was strong and seamed with tiny lines.  The prominence
of his features was accentuated by the thinness of the
face.  Beady black eyes burned beneath the shadows of
heavy brows.  A shock of iron-grey hair brushed his
shoulders.  In one hand he held a leather-bound book, a
long thumb fixed on the printed page from which his
attention had been momentarily diverted by his survey of
the woodland scene.
</p>

<p>
"Desolation!" he murmured, "desolation! the natural
home of ignorance."
</p>

<p>
At the sound of his voice the old horse stood still.
"Thomas," cried the rider sternly, "did I command you
to halt?"
</p>

<p>
From his leather boot-leg he extracted a long wand of
seasoned hickory and brought it down on the bay flank
with a cutting swish.  The hickory represented the symbol
of progress to Mr. George G. Johnston, the new teacher of
Scotia school.  Certain it was it had the desired effect in
this particular instance.  The aged horse broke into a
jerky gallop which soon carried the rider out into more
open country.
</p>

<p>
Here farms, hemmed in by rude rail-fences, looked up
from valley and hillside.  Occasionally a house of greater
pretensions than its fellows, and built of unplaned lumber,
gleamed in the morning sunlight in gay contrast to the
dun-colored log ones.  But the eternal forest, the primitive
offering of earth's first substance, obtruded even here,
and the rider's face set in a frown as he surveyed the
vista before him.
</p>

<p>
Descending into a valley he saw that the farm homes,
which from the height seemed closely set together, were
really quite a distance from each other.  He reined up
before a small frame house and, dismounting, allowed his
hungry horse to crop the grass, as he opened the gate and
made up the path.  A shaggie collie bounded around the
corner of the building and down to meet him, bristles
erect and all the antagonism of a bush-dog for a stranger
in its bearing.  It was followed by a big man and a boy.
</p>

<p>
"Here you, Joe, come back here and behave yourself,"
the master thundered and the dog turned and slunk back
along the path.
</p>

<p>
"Mornin', sir," greeted Cobin Keeler.
</p>

<p>
In one hand he carried a huge butcher-knife, in the
other a long whetstone.  More big knives glittered in the
leather belt about his waist.  "Jest sharpenin' my knives
ag'in the hog-killin'," he explained, noting the stranger's
startled look.
</p>

<p>
The teacher advanced, his fears at rest.  "My name is
Johnston," he said, "George G. Johnston.  I was directed
here, sir.  You are Mr. Keeler, are you not, one of the
trustees of the school of which I am to have charge?"
</p>

<p>
Keeler thrust out a huge hand.  "That's me," he
answered.  "You're jest in time fer breakfast.  It's nigh
ready.  Come 'round back an' wash up.  Maurice, go put
the teacher's horse in the stable an' give him a feed."
</p>

<p>
The teacher followed his host, gingerly rubbing the
knuckles which had been left blue by the farmer's strong
grip.
</p>

<p>
The boy, who had been studying the man before him,
turned away to execute his father's order.  If he knew
anything about teachers&mdash;and he did&mdash;he and the other
lads of the community were in for a high old time, he told
himself.  He went down to the gate, the dog trotting at
his heels.
</p>

<p>
"Joe," he commanded, "go back home," and the collie
lay down on the path, head between his forepaws.
</p>

<p>
The boy went out through the gate and approached the
feeding horse cautiously.  His quick eyes appraised its
lean sides and noted the long welt made by the hickory on
the clearly outlined ribs beneath the bay hide.
</p>

<p>
"Poor ol' beggar," he said gently.
</p>

<p>
At the sound of his voice the horse lifted his head and
gazed at the boy in seeming surprise.  A wisp of grass
dangled from his mouth; his ears pricked forward.
Perhaps something in the boy's voice recalled a voice he had
known far back along his checkered life, when he was a
colt and a bare-legged youngster fed him sugar and rode
astride his back.
</p>

<p>
"He ought'a get a taste o' the gad hisself," muttered
Maurice.  "An' he's goin' to be our teacher, oh, Gash!
Well, I kin see where me an' Billy Wilson gets ourn&mdash;maybe."
</p>

<p>
He patted the horse's thin neck.  "Come, ol' feller, I'll
stuff you with good oats fer once," he promised.
</p>

<p>
The horse reached forward his long muzzle and lipped
one of the boy's ears.  "Say horses don't understand!"
grinned Maurice.  "Gee!  I guess maybe they do
understand, though."
</p>

<p>
He gave the horse another pat and led him down the
path into the stable.  As he unsaddled him Maurice noticed
the hickory wand which Mr. Johnston had left inserted
between the upper loops of a stirrup.
</p>

<p>
"Hully gee! ol' feller, look!"  Maurice extracted the
wand and held it up before the animal's gaze.  "Oh, don't
put your ears back an' grin at me.  I ain't goin' to use
it on you," laughed the lad.  "Look!  This is what I'm
goin' to do with that ol' bruiser's pointer."  From a
trouser's pocket he extracted a jackknife.  "Now horsie,
jest you watch me close.  The next time he makes a cut
at you he's goin' to get the surprise of his life.  There,
see?  I've cut it through.  Now I'll jest rub on some of
this here clay to hide the cut.  There you be!  If I know
anythin' 'bout seasoned hickory that pointer's goin' to
split into needles right in his hand.  I hope they go through
his ol' fist and clinch on t'other side."
</p>

<p>
Maurice gave the tired horse a feed of oats, tossed a
bundle of timothy into the manger, slapped the bay flank
once again and went up the path to his breakfast.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Keeler, a swarthy woman, almost as broad as she
was tall, and with an habitual cloud of gloom on her
features, met him at the door.  She was very deaf and spoke
in the loud, querulous tone so often used by people
suffering from that affliction.
</p>

<p>
"Have you seen him?" she shouted.  "What you think
of him, Maurice?"
</p>

<p>
Maurice drew her outside and closed the door.  "Come
over behind the woodpile, Ma, an' I'll tell you," he
answered cautiously.
</p>

<p>
"No, tell me here."
</p>

<p>
"Can't.  He might hear me."
</p>

<p>
"Then you ain't took to that new teacher, Maurice?"
</p>

<p>
"Not what you'd notice, Ma.  He ain't any like Mr. Stanhope.
His face&mdash;I ain't likin' it a bit.  Besides, Ma,
he flogs his poor horse somethin' awful."
</p>

<p>
"How do you know that?" asked the mother, eying
him sharply.
</p>

<p>
"Cause he left long welts on him.  He's out in the
stable.  Go see fer yourself."
</p>

<p>
"No, I ain't got time.  I got t' fry some more eggs an'
ham.  Go 'long in to your breakfast, an' see you keep
your mouth shut durin' the meal.  An' look here," she
admonished, "if I ketch you apullin' the cat's tail durin'
after-breakfast prayers I'll wollop you till you can't stand."
</p>

<p>
Maurice meekly followed his mother inside and slipped
into his accustomed place at the table.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Johnston was certainly doing justice to the crisp
ham and eggs on the platter before him.  Occasionally he
lifted his black eyes to flash a look at his host, who was
entertaining him with the history of the settlement and
its people.
</p>

<p>
"You'll find Deacon Ringold a man whose word is as
good as his bond," Cobin was saying.  "I'm married to
his sister, Hannah, but I ain't sayin' this on that account.
The deacon is a right good livin' man, fond of his own
opinions an' all that, an' close on a bargain, but a good
Christian man.  He's better off than anybody else in
these parts.  But what he got he got honest.  I'll say that,
even if he is my own brother-in-law."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes," spoke Mr. Johnston, impatiently.  "No
doubt I shall get to know Mr. Ringold very well.  Now,
sir, concerning your other neighbors?"  Mr. Johnston
held a dripping yolk of egg poised, peering from beneath
his brows at his host.
</p>

<p>
"Well, there's the Proctors, five families of 'em an'
every last one of 'em a brother to the other."
</p>

<p>
"Meaning, I presume, that there are five brothers by
the name of Proctor living in the community."
</p>

<p>
"By Gosh, you've hit it right on the head.  That's what
eddication does fer a man&mdash;makes him sharp as a razor.
Yes, they're brothers an' so much alike all I've got to do
is describe one of 'em an' you have 'em all."
</p>

<p>
"Remarkable," murmured Mr. Johnston.  "Remarkable,
indeed!"
</p>

<p>
"Did you say more tea, teacher?"  Mrs. Keeler was
at his elbow, steaming tea-pot in hand.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, I will have another cup," Mr. Johnston
answered, and turned his eyes back to Cobin.
</p>

<p>
"You have a neighbor named Stanhope, my predecessor,
I understand," he said slowly.
</p>

<p>
"I'm proud to say we have, sir," beamed Keeler, "an'
a squarer, finer young man never lived.  A mighty good
teacher he was too, let me tell you."
</p>

<p>
"I have no doubt.  I have heard sterling reports of
him; if he erred in his task it was because he was too
lenient.  Tell me, Mr. Keeler, is there not some history
attached to him concerning a will, or property left by a
man by the name of Scroggie?  I'll admit I have no motive
in so questioning save that of curiosity, but one wishes to
know all one can learn about the man one is to follow.
Is that not so, ma'am?" he asked, turning to the watchful
hostess.
</p>

<p>
"More ham?  Certainly."  Mrs. Keeler came forward
with a platter, newly fried, and scraped two generous
slices onto Mr. Johnston's plate.  "Now, sir, don't you
be affeard to holler out when you want more," said the
hospitable housewife.
</p>

<p>
"Ma's deefness makes her misunderstan' sometimes,"
Cobin explained in an undertone to the teacher.  "But I
was jest about to tell you Mr. Stanhope's strange history,
sir, an' about ol' Scroggie's will.  You sse the Stanhopes
was the very first to drop in here an' take up land, father
an' son named Frank, who wasn't much more'n a boy, but
with a mighty good eddication.
</p>

<p>
"Roger Stanhope didn't live long but while he lived
he was a right good sort of man to foller an' before he
died he had the satisfaction of seein' the place in which
he was one of the first to settle grow up into a real
neighborhood.  Young Frank had growed into a big, strappin'
feller by this time an' took hold of the work his father had
begun, an' I must say he did marvels in the clearin' an'
burnin'.
</p>

<p>
"So things went along fer a few years.  Then come a
letter from England to Roger Stanhope.  Frank read it
to me.  Seems they wanted Stanhope back home, if he was
alive; if not they wanted his son to come.  Frank didn't
even answer that letter.  He says to me, 'Mr. Keeler, this
spot's good enough fer me.'  An' by gosh! he stayed.
</p>

<p>
"When this settlement growed big enough fer a school,
young Frank, who had a school teacher's di-ploma, offered
to teach it.  His farm was pretty well cleared by this time,
so he got a man named Henry Burke to work it fer him
an' Burke's wife to keep house.  That was five years ago,
an' Frank has taught the Valley School ever since, till
now."
</p>

<p>
Keeler paused, and sighed deeply.  "'Course, sir, you've
heerd what happened an' how?  He was tryin' to save
some horses from a burnin' stable.  A blazin' beam fell
across his face; his eyes they&mdash;"  Keeler's voice grew
husky.
</p>

<p>
"I've heard," said Mr. Johnston.  "His was a brave
and commendable act."
</p>

<p>
"But he did a braver thing than that," cried Cobin.
"He giv' up the girl who was to marry him, 'cause, he
said, his days from now on must be useless ones, an' he
wouldn't bind the woman he loved to his bleakness an'
blackness.  Them was his very words, sir."
</p>

<p>
To this Mr. Johnston made no audible reply.  He simply
nodded, waiting with suspended fork, for his narrator to
resume.
</p>

<p>
"Concerning the purported will of the eccentric
Mr. Scroggie?" he ventured at length, his host having lapsed
into silence.
</p>

<p>
Keeler roused himself from his abstraction and resumed:
"Right next to the Stanhope farm there stood about a
thousand acres of the purtiest hardwoods you ever clap't
an eye on, sir.  An ol' hermit of a drunken Scotchman,
Scroggie by name, owned that land.  He lived in a dirty
little cabin an' was so mean even the mice was scared to
eat the food he scrimped himself on.  He had money too,
lots an' lots of gold money.  I've seen it myself.  He kept
it hid somewhere.
</p>

<p>
"When the Stanhopes built their home on the farm,
which was then mostly woods, old Scroggie behaved
somethin' awful.  He threatened to shoot Stanhope.  But
Stanhope only laughed an' went on with his cuttin' an'
stump-pullin'.  Scroggie used to swear he'd murder both
of 'em, an' he was always sayin' that if he died his ghost
would come back an' ha'nt the Stanhopes.  Yes, he said
that once in my own hearin'.
</p>

<p>
"One night, two years after Roger Stanhope died, old
Scroggie got drunk an' would have froze to death if
Frank hadn't found him an' carried him into his own
home.  Scroggie cursed Frank fer it when he came
round but Frank paid no attention to him.  After that,
Scroggie&mdash;who was too sick to be moved&mdash;got to takin'
long spells of quiet.  He would jest set still an' watch
Frank nights when the two was alone together.
</p>

<p>
"After a while the old man got strong enough to go
home.  Soon after that he disappeared an' stayed away
fer nearly three weeks.  Then, all at once, he turned up at
home ag'in.  He came over to Stanhope's house every now
an' ag'in to visit with him.  One night he says to Frank
after they had had supper: 'Frank,' says he, 'I've been
over to Cleveland an' I've made my will.  I've left you
everythin' I own.  You're the only decent person I've
known since I lost my ol' mother.  I want that thousand
acre woods to stand jest as God made it as long as I'm
alive; when I die you kin do what you like with it.'  Then
afore Frank could even thank him the old man got up an'
hobbled out.
</p>

<p>
"Next mornin'," continued Cobin, "Frank went over
to see old Scroggie.  He wanted to hear him say what he
told him the night afore, ag'in.  It was gettin' along
towards spring; the day was warm an' smelled of maple
sap.  Scroggie's cabin door was standin' ajar, Frank says.
The ol' man was sittin' in his chair, a Bible upside down
on his knees.  He was dead!
</p>

<p>
"Frank told Mr. Reddick, the preacher who came to
bury old Scroggie, all that had passed between him an'
the dead man but although they hunted high an' low fer
the will, they never found it.  Nor did they find any of
the money the ol' miser must have left behind&mdash;not a
solitary cent.  That was over a year ago, an' they haven't
found money or will yet.  But this goes to show what a
real feller Frank Stanhope is.  He put a fine grave stone
up for ol' Scroggie an' had his name engraved on it.  Yes
he done that, an' all he ever got from the dead man was
his curses.
</p>

<p>
"Well, soon after they put old Scroggie under the sod,
along comes a nephew of the dead man.  No doubt in the
world he was Scroggie's nephew.  He looked like him, an'
besides he had the papers to prove his claim that he was
the dead man's only livin' relative.  An' as Scroggie
hadn't left no will, this man was rightful heir to what he
had left behin', 'cordin' to law.  He spent a week er two
prowlin' round, huntin' fer the dead man's buried money.
At last he got disgusted huntin' an' findin' nuthin' an'
went away."
</p>

<p>
"And he left no address behind?" questioned Mr. Johnston.
</p>

<p>
"He surely did not," answered Cobin.  "Nobody
knows where he went&mdash;nor cares.  But nobody can do
anythin' with that timber without his sayso.  It's a year
or more since ol' Scroggie died.  People do say that his
ghost floats about the old cabin, at nights, but of course
that can't be, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Superstitious nonsense," scoffed the teacher.  "And so
the will was never found?"
</p>

<p>
"No, er the buried money," sighed Cobin.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Johnston pushed his chair back from the table.
"Thank you exceedingly, Mr. Keeler.  I have enjoyed
your breakfast and your conversation very much indeed.
Madam," he said, rising and turning to Mrs. Keeler,
"permit me to extend to you my heartfelt gratitude for
your share in the splendid hospitality that has been
accorded me.  I hope to see you again, some day."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly," returned Mrs. Keeler, "Cobin!  Maurice! kneel
down beside your chairs.  The teacher wants to
pray."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Johnston frowned, then observing his host and
hostess fall to their knees, he too got stiffly down beside
his chair.  He prayed long and fervently and ended by
asking God to help him lead these people from the shadow
into enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
It was during that prayer that Maurice, chancing to
glance at the window, saw Billy Wilson's pet crow, Croaker,
peering in at him with black eyes.  Now, as Croaker often
acted as carrier between the boys, his presence meant only
one thing&mdash;Billy had sent him some message.  Cautiously
Maurice got down on all fours and crept toward the door.
</p>

<p>
"Now teacher," said Keeler, the prayer over, "you jest
set still, an' I'll send Maurice out after your horse."
</p>

<p>
He glanced around in search of the boy.  "Why, bless
my soul, he's gone!" he exclaimed.  "There's a youngster
you'll need to watch close, teacher," he said grimly.
</p>

<p>
"Well sir, you jest rest easy an' I'll get your horse
myself."

CHAPTER IV
<br /><br />
THE MESSAGE CROAKER BROUGHT
</h3>

<p>
"Missus Wilson, where's Billy?"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson turned to the door, wiped her red face on
her apron, and finished emptying a pan of hot cookies into
the stone crock, before answering, sternly:
</p>

<p>
"He's down to the far medder, watchin' the gap,
Maurice.  Don't you go near him."
</p>

<p>
"No ma'am, I won't.  Jest wondered where he was,
that's all."
</p>

<p>
"I 'low you're tryin' to coax him away fishin' er
somethin'."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no ma'am.  I gotta get right back home to Ma.
She's not very well, an' she'll be needin' me."
</p>

<p>
"Fer land sakes! you don't say so, Maurice.  Is she
very bad?"  The tones were sympathetic now.  Maurice
nodded, and glanced longingly at the fresh batch of brown
cookies.
</p>

<p>
"She was carryin' the big meat-platter on her arm an'
she fell with her arm under her&mdash;an' broke it."
</p>

<p>
"Lord love us!"  Mrs. Wilson started to undo her
apron.  "Why didn't you tell me before, you freckle-faced
jackass, you!  Lord knows what use you boys are
anyways!  Think of you, hangin' 'round here askin' fer
Billy and your poor Ma at home groanin' in pain an'
needin' help.  Ain't you 'shamed of yourself?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes ma'am," admitted Maurice cheerfully.  "I guess
I should'a told you first off but Ma she said if you was
busy not to say anythin' 'bout her breakin' it."
</p>

<p>
"Well, we'll see about that.  No neighbor in this here
settlement is ever goin' to say that Mary Wilson ever
turned her back on a feller-bein's distress.  I'll go right
over to your place with you now, Maurice.  Come along."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson was outside, by this time, and tying on her
sun-bonnet.  Maurice held back.  She grasped his arm and
hustled him down the walk.
</p>

<p>
"Is it broke bad, Maurice?" she asked anxiously.
</p>

<p>
Maurice, peering about among the trees, answered
absently.
</p>

<p>
"Yes ma'am.  I guess she'll never be able to use it
ag'in."
</p>

<p>
"Oh pity sake!  Let's hurry."
</p>

<p>
Maurice was compelled to quicken his steps in order to
keep up to the long strides of the anxious woman.
Suddenly he halted.  "Missis Wilson," he said, "you fergot
to take that last pan o' cookies out'a the oven."
</p>

<p>
The woman raised her hands in consternation.
</p>

<p>
"So I did," she exclaimed.  "You stay right here an'
I'll go back and take it out now."
</p>

<p>
"Let me go," said Maurice quickly.  "I know jest how
to do it an' kin get through in less'n half the time it'll
take you."
</p>

<p>
"Well, run along then.  I best keep right on.  Your
poor Ma'll be needin' me."
</p>

<p>
Maurice was off like a shot.  As he rounded the house
on a lope he ran into Billy, coming from the opposite
direction.  Billy's cotton blouse was bulging.  In one hand
he carried the smoking bake-pan, in the other a fat cookie
deeply scalloped on one side.
</p>

<p>
"Where you goin' so fast, Maurice?" he accosted, his
mouth full.
</p>

<p>
Maurice glanced fearfully over his shoulder.  "Hush,
Bill.  If your Ma happens to come back here it'll go bad
with me."
</p>

<p>
Billy held out the pan to his chum and waited until
Maurice had filled his pockets.  Then he asked: "Where's
she gone?"
</p>

<p>
"Over to our place.  I told her about Ma fallin' an'
breakin' the meat-platter, an' I guess she misunderstood.
She tried to take me along with her.  I had an awful time
to get 'way from her."
</p>

<p>
Billy laughed.  "Gee!  Ma's like that.  Nobody gets
'way from her very easy.  Here, fill your shirt with the
rest o' these cookies, an I'll take the pan back; then we'll
be goin'."
</p>

<p>
"Fish ought'a bite fine today," said Maurice as he
stowed the cookies away in his bosom.
</p>

<p>
"You bet.  The wind's south.  Have you got the
worms dug?"
</p>

<p>
"Yep.  They're in a can in my pocket.  Did Croaker
come back?" he inquired, as the two made their way down
the path.
</p>

<p>
"Sure he came back.  He's a wise crow, that Croaker,
an', Oh gosh! don't he hate Ma, though!  He gets up in
a tree out o' reach of her broom, an' jest don't he call her
names in crow talk?  Ma says she'll kill him if ever she
gets close enough to him an' she will, too."
</p>

<p>
"Well sir, I nigh died when I seen him settin' on our
winder-sill," laughed Maurice.  "We was havin' mornin'
prayer; the new teacher was at our place an' he was
prayin'.  Croaker strutted up an' down the sill, peerin'
in an' openin' an' shuttin' his mouth like he was callin'
that old hawk-faced teacher every name he could think
of.  I saw he had a paper tied 'round his neck so I crawled
on my hands an' knees past Ma, an' slipped out.  If Ma
hadn't been so deef, she'd have heard me an' nabbed me
sure."
</p>

<p>
Billy chuckled.  "Then you got my message off of
Croaker, Maurice?"
</p>

<p>
"Yep; but by jinks!  I had a awful time guessin'
what you meant by them marks you made on the paper.
Darn it all, Bill, why can't you write what you want'a
say, instead of makin' marks that nobody kin understan'?"
</p>

<p>
"There you go, ag'in," cried Billy.  "How many times
have I gotta tell you, Maurice, that Trigger Finger Tim
never used writin'.  He used symbols&mdash;that's what he
used.  Do you know what a symbol is, you poor blockhead?"
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-053"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-053.jpg" alt="Bill's message" />
<br />
</p>

<p>
"I should say I do.  It's a brass cap what women use
to keep the needle from runnin' under their finger-nail."
</p>

<p>
"Naw, Maurice.  A symbol is a mark what means somethin'.
Have you got that message I sent you?  Well, give
it here an' I'll show you.  Now then, you see them two
marks standin' up 'longside each other?"
</p>

<p>
"Yep."
</p>

<p>
"Well, what do you think they stand fer?"
</p>

<p>
"I thought maybe you meant 'em fer a couple of trees,
Bill."
</p>

<p>
"Well I didn't.  Them two marks are symbols, signifyin'
a gap."
</p>

<p>
"A gap?  Hully Gee!"
</p>

<p>
"Yep, an' this here animal settin' in that gap, what
you think it is?"
</p>

<p>
Maurice shook his head.  "It's maybe a cow!" he
guessed hopefully.
</p>

<p>
"Nope, it's a dog.  Now then, you see these two boys
runnin' away from the gap?"
</p>

<p>
"Gosh, is that what they be, Bill?  Yep, I see 'em."
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's me an' you.  Now then, what you s'pose
I meant by them symbols?  I meant this.  <i>I've gotta watch
gap.  Fetch your dog over an' we'll set him to watch it,
an' we'll skin out an' go fishin'.</i>"
</p>

<p>
Maurice whistled.  "Well I'll be jiggered!" he
exclaimed.  "I wish't I'd knowed that.  Say, tell you
what I'll do.  I'll sneak up through the woods an' whistle
Joe over here now."
</p>

<p>
"No, never mind.  I bribed Anse to watch that gap
fer me."
</p>

<p>
"What did you have t' give him?"
</p>

<p>
"Nuthin'.  Promised I wouldn't tell him no ghost
stories fer a week if he'd help me out."
</p>

<p>
They had topped a wooded hill and were descending
into a wide green valley, studded with clumps of red
willows and sloping towards a winding stretch of pale
green rushes through which the white face of the creek
flashed as though in a smile of welcome.  Red winged
blackbirds clarioned shrilly from rush and cat-tail.  A
brown bittern rose solemnly and made across the marsh
in ungainly flight.  A blue crane, frogging in the shallows,
paused in its task with long neck stretched, then got
slowly to wing, long pipe-stem legs thrust straight out
behind.  A pair of nesting black ducks arose with soft
quacks and drifted up and out, bayward.
</p>

<p>
Billy, who stood still to watch them, was recalled
suddenly to earth by his companion's voice.
</p>

<p>
"Bill, our punt's gone!"
</p>

<p>
With a bound, Billy was beside him, and peering through
the rushes into the tiny bay in which they kept their boat.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Gee whitticker!" he exclaimed.  "Who do you
s'pose had the nerve to take it?"
</p>

<p>
Maurice shook his head.  "None of our gang 'ud take
it," he said.  "Likely some of them Sand-sharks."
</p>

<p>
"That's so," Billy broke off a marsh-flag and champed
it in his teeth.
</p>

<p>
Maurice was climbing a tall poplar standing on the bank
of the creek.  "I say, Billy," he cried excitedly.  "There
she is, jest 'round the bend.  They've beached her in that
piece of woods.  It's Joe LaRose an' Art Shipley that took
her, I'll bet a cookie.  They're always goin' 'cross there
to hunt fer turtle's eggs."
</p>

<p>
"Then come on!" shouted Billy.
</p>

<p>
"Where to?"
</p>

<p>
"Down opposite the punt.  I'm goin' t' strip an' swim
across after her."
</p>

<p>
Maurice dropped like a squirrel from the poplar.  "An'
leave them boat thieves stranded?" he panted.  "Oh
gosh! but won't that serve 'em right!"
</p>

<p>
"Let's hustle," urged Billy.  "They may come back
any minute."
</p>

<p>
They ran quickly up the valley, Billy unfastening his
few garments as they ran.  By the time Billy had reached
the bend he was in readiness for the swim across.
Without a thought of the long leeches&mdash;"blood-suckers" the
boys called them&mdash;which lay on the oozy bottom of the
creek's shallows ready to fasten on the first bare foot that
came their way, he waded out toward the channel.
</p>

<p>
"Bill, watch out!" warned Maurice.  "There's a big
womper coiled on that lily-root.  You're makin' right
fer it."
</p>

<p>
"I see it," returned Billy.  "I guess I ain't scared of
no snakes in these parts."
</p>

<p>
"But this beggar is coiled," cried his friend.  "If he
strikes you, he'll rip you wide open with his horny nose.
Don't go, Bill."
</p>

<p>
"Bah! he's uncoilin', Maurice; he'll slip off, see if he
don't.  There, what did I tell you?" as the long mottled
snake slid softly into the water.  "You can't tell me
anythin' 'bout wompers."
</p>

<p>
"But what if a snappin'-turtle should get hold of your
toe?" shuddered Maurice.
</p>

<p>
"Shut up!" Billy commanded.  "Do you want them
Sand-sharks to hear you?  You keep still now, I'm goin'
after our punt."
</p>

<p>
Billy was out in mid stream now, swimming with swift,
noiseless strokes toward the boat.  Just as he reached it
the willows along shore parted and two boys, both larger
than himself, made a leap for the punt.  Billy threw
himself into the boat and as the taller of the two jumped for
it his fist shot out and caught him fairly on the jaw.  He
toppled back half into the water.  Billy seized the paddle
and swung it back over his shoulder.  The other boy halted
in his tracks.  Another moment and the punt was floating
out in midstream.
</p>

<p>
LaRose had crawled to shore and sat dripping and
sniffling on the bank.
</p>

<p>
"Now, maybe the next time you boat-thieves find a
punt you'll think twice afore you take it," shouted Billy.
</p>

<p>
"How're we goin' to get back 'cross the crick?"
whined the vanquished LaRose.
</p>

<p>
"Swim it, same's I did," Billy called back.
</p>

<p>
"But the snakes an' turtles!" wailed the marooned pair.
</p>

<p>
"You gotta take a chance.  I took one."  Billy urged
the punt forward across the creek to where the grinning
and highly delighted Maurice waited.
</p>

<p>
"Jump in here, an' let's get fishin'."
</p>

<p>
Maurice lost no time.  "Where'll we go, Bill?"
</p>

<p>
"Up to the mouth.  There's green bass up there an'
lots of small frogs, if we need 'em, fer bait."

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br /><br />
A WILDERNESS MERCHANT
</h3>

<p>
Caleb Spencer, proprietor of the Twin Oaks store, paused
at his garden gate to light his corncob pipe.  The next
three hours would be his busy time.  The farmers of Scotia
would come driving in for their mail and to make necessary
purchases of his wares.  His pipe alight to his satisfaction,
Caleb crossed the road, then stood still in his tracks
to fasten his admiring gaze on the rambling, unpainted
building which was his pride and joy.  He had built that
store himself.  With indefatigable pains and patience he
had fashioned it to suit his mind.  Every evening, just at
this after-supper hour, he stood still for a time to admire
it, as he was doing now.
</p>

<p>
Having quaffed his customary draught of delight from
the picture before him Caleb resumed his walk to the store,
pausing at its door to straighten into place the long bench
kept there for the accommodation of visiting customers.
As he swung the bench against the wall he bent and peered
closely at two sets of newly-carved initials on its smooth
surface.
</p>

<p>
"W.W." he read, and frowned.  "By ding!  That's
that Billy Wilson.  Now let's see, 'A.S.'  I wonder who
them initials stand fer?"  With a shake of his grizzled mop
he entered the store.
</p>

<p>
A slim girl in a gingham dress stood in front of the
counter placing parcels in a basket.  She turned a flushed
face, lit with brown roguish eyes, on Caleb, as he came in.
</p>

<p>
"Had your supper, Pa?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yep."  Caleb bent and scrutinized the basket.
</p>

<p>
"Whose parcels are them, Ann?" he questioned.
</p>

<p>
"Mrs. Keeler's," his daughter answered.  "Billy
Wilson left the order."
</p>

<p>
"Hump, he did, eh?  Well, let's see the slip."  He
took the piece of paper from the counter and read:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  One box fruit-crackers.<br />
  10 pounds granulated sugar.<br />
  Two pounds cheese.<br />
  1 pound raisins.<br />
  1 pound lemon peel.<br />
  4 cans salmon.<br />
  50 sticks hoarhound candy.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
There were other items but Caleb read no further.  He
stood back sucking the stem of his pipe thoughtfully.
"Whereabouts did that Billy go, Ann?" he asked at
length.
</p>

<p>
"Why, he didn't go.  He's in the liquor-shop settin' a
trap for that rat, Pa."
</p>

<p>
"Oh he is, eh?  Well, tell him to come out here; I want
to see him."
</p>

<p>
Caleb waited until his daughter turned to execute his
order, then the frown melted from his face and a wide
grin took its place.  "The young reprobate," he muttered.
"What'll that boy be up to next, I wonder?  I've got t'
teach him a lesson, ding me! if I haven't.  It's clear enough
t' me that him and that young Keeler are shapin' fer a
little excursion, up bush, and this is the way they take
to get their fodder."
</p>

<p>
He turned slowly as his daughter and Billy entered from
the rear of the shop and let his eyes rest on the boy's
face.  "How are you, Billy?" he asked genially.
</p>

<p>
"I'm well, thanks," and Billy gazed innocently back
into Caleb's eyes.  "I hope your rheumatiz is better,
Mr. Spencer."
</p>

<p>
"It is," said Caleb shortly, "and my eyes are gettin'
sharper every day, Billy."
</p>

<p>
"That's good," said Billy and bent to pick up the
basket.
</p>

<p>
"Jest a minute, young man."  Caleb's voice was stern.
"I see you've cut your own and your best gal's initials
onto my new bench.  Did you have much trouble doin' it,
might I ask?"
</p>

<p>
Billy stood up, a grin on his face.  "That pine bench
looked so invitin' I jest couldn't help tryin' my new knife
on it," he explained.  "But I didn't s'pose fer a minute
that you'd mind."
</p>

<p>
"Well, by ding!  I don't know but what I <i>do</i> mind.
What if you should take a notion, some day, to carve up
the side of this buildin', hey?"
</p>

<p>
Billy grew thoughtful.  "I hadn't thought o' that," he
said slowly.  "It's pine, too, ain't it?  It 'ud carve fine."
</p>

<p>
Caleb turned quickly towards a pile of goods, behind
which an audible titter had sounded.
</p>

<p>
"Ann," he commanded, "you run along and get your
supper."
</p>

<p>
He waited until his daughter had closed the door behind
her.  "Now Billy," he said, sternly, "understan' me when
I say that if you ever so much as lay a knife-blade onto
the walls of this here store I'll jest naturally pinch the
freckles off'n your nose, one by one.  Hear that?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Well, heed it, and heed it close.  I'll overlook the
cuttin' of my new bench, but, by ding!  I'd ruther you'd
carve me than carve this store."  He paused abruptly and
bent on Billy a quizzical look.  "Whose 'nitials are them
under yourn?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
Billy started.  "Oh gosh!  I dunno, Mr. Spencer; I jest
cut the first ones come into my head."
</p>

<p>
"Umph!  I'm not so green as I look.  I know whose
they be.  They're Ann's."
</p>

<p>
Billy was silent.  Should he tell the truth and say that
he had carved Ann's initials on the bench and those of
Walter Watland beneath them at that young lady's
pleading request?  No!
</p>

<p>
"Well?" Caleb asked finally.  "What about it?"
</p>

<p>
Billy drew himself up and lied like a gentleman.  "I
guess that's all there is about it," he said with dignity.
"Ann's my girl, an' she said I could cut my 'nitials under
hers if I wanted to take the chance."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, so she's your gal, is she?"  Caleb thrust his hands
deep into his pockets, striving hard to keep his face stern.
"How long you and Ann been sweetheartin'?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Five er six years; maybe longer."
</p>

<p>
"Loramighty!"  Caleb sank weakly on a pile of horse-blankets,
and gasped.  "But, Billy, she's only twelve now,
and you&mdash;you can't be much more'n fourteen at most."
</p>

<p>
"I'm growin' fifteen," said Billy gravely.  "Me an'
Ann's been goin' together fer quite a long spell."
</p>

<p>
Caleb placed his empty pipe in one pocket, fished in
another and drew out a plug of Radiant Star chewing
tobacco.  He took a generous bite from one corner of the
plug and champed it meditatively.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Billy," he said with a twinkle in his eye,
"seein's we're to be right close related, some day, I guess
it's up to me to give you your supper.  You go right along
over to the house and eat with Ann."
</p>

<p>
"But I'm not hungry, Mr. Spencer," said Billy quickly.
</p>

<p>
"That don't make no difference; you go along.  I see
Ann's made a mistake in doin' up Mrs. Keeler's parcels.
You can't go back for a bit, anyways, so you might as well
have your supper."
</p>

<p>
Billy went out and Spencer watched him cross the road
and enter the cottage.  "Well, now," he chuckled, "ain't
that boy a tartar?  But," he added, "he's got to be slicker
than he is to fool old Caleb.  Now, you jest watch me."
</p>

<p>
He lifted the basket to the counter and, taking the
parcels from it, carefully emptied their contents back into
the drawers from which they had been filled.  Then from
beneath the counter he drew out a box and with exquisite
pains filled each of the empty bags and the cracker-box
with sawdust.  He tied the bags, packed them in the basket,
tucked a roll of tea lead in the bottom, to give the basket
weight, and placed it on the counter.  Then he went
outside to sit on the bench and await Billy's return.
</p>

<p>
Caleb had come to Scotia Settlement when it was little
more than a bald spot on the pate of the hardwoods.
Gypsy-like he had strayed into the settlement and, to use
his own vernacular, had pitched his wigwam to stay.  One
month later a snug log cabin stood on the wooded hillside
overlooking the valley, and the sound of Caleb's axe could
be heard all day long, as he cleared a garden spot in the
forest.  That forest ran almost to the white sands of Lake
Erie, pausing a quarter of a mile from its shore as though
fearing to advance further.  On this narrow strip of land
the pines and cedars had taken their stand, as if in defiance
of the more rugged trees of the upland.  They grew close
together in thickets so dense that beneath them, even on
the brightest day, blue-white twilight rested always.
Running westward, these coniferous trees grew bolder and
widened so as to almost cover the broad finger-like point
of land which separated Rond Eau Bay from Lake Erie,
and thither many of the wild things crept, as civilization
advanced to claim their old roaming grounds.  The point,
known as Point Aux Pines, was ten miles long, affording
abundance of food and perfect shelter.
</p>

<p>
But on the uplands the forests grew sparser as the axes
of rugged homesteaders, who had followed in the footsteps
of Caleb Spencer, bit home.  Gradually farms were cleared,
rough stumpy fields the tilling of which tested the hearts
of the strongest, but whose rich soil gladdened even the
most weary.  A saw mill was erected on the banks of a
stream known as Levee Creek.  Gradually the rough log
cabins of the settlers were torn down to be replaced by
more modern houses of lumber.
</p>

<p>
And then Caleb Spencer had built his store and with
far-seeing judgment had stocked it with nearly every
variety of goods a growing community needs.  Drygoods,
Groceries, Hardware &amp; Liquors!  These comprehensive
words, painted on a huge sign, stared out at all who passed
along the road and in still more glaring letters beneath
was the announcement, "Caleb Spencer, Proprietor."
</p>

<p>
Everybody liked Caleb.  Even old man Scroggie had
been fond of him, which is saying a great deal.  It was
said the old miser even trusted the gaunt storekeeper to a
certain degree.  At any rate it was commonly known that
shortly before he died Scroggie had given into Spencer's
keeping, to be locked away in his rusty old store safe, a
certain legal-looking document.  Deacon Ringold and Cobin
Keeler had witnessed the transaction.  Accordingly, after
Scroggie was buried and a search for the will failed to
disclose it, it was perhaps natural that a delegation of
neighbors should wait on Caleb and question him concerning
the paper which the deceased man had given him.  To
everybody's surprise Caleb had flared up and told the
delegation that the paper in question was the consummation of
a private matter between himself and the dead man, and
that he didn't have to show it and didn't intend to show it.
</p>

<p>
Of course that settled it.  The delegation apologized, and
Caleb tapped a keg of cider and opened a box of choice
biscuits just to show that there were no hard feelings.
Now this in itself was surely indisputable proof of the
confidence his neighbors reposed in Caleb's veracity and
honesty, but considering the fact that Caleb had once
quarrelled with the elder Stanhope, later refusing all
overtures of friendship from the latter, and had even gone so
far as to cherish the same feeling of animosity toward the
son, Frank, that trust was little short of sublime.  For,
providing Caleb disliked Frank Stanhope&mdash;and he did
and made no attempt to hide it&mdash;what would be more
natural than that he should keep him from his rightful
inheritance if he could?
</p>

<p>
But nobody mistrusted Caleb, Frank Stanhope least of
all; and so, for the time being, the incident of the legal
document was forgotten.
</p>

<p>
Tonight, as Caleb sat outside on the bench waiting for
the first evening customers to arrive, he reviewed the
pleasant years of his life in this restful spot and was
satisfied.  Suddenly he sat erect.  From the edge of a walnut
grove on the far side of the road came a low warble, sweet
as the song of a wild bird, but with a minor note of
sadness in its lilting.
</p>

<p>
"That's old Harry and his tin whistle," muttered Caleb,
"Glory be! but can't he jest make that thing sing?"
</p>

<p>
Softly the last note died, and then the player emerged
from the grove.  He was little and bent.  He wore a ragged
suit of corduroys and a battered felt hat with a red feather
stuck jauntily in its band.  His face was small, dark, and
unshaven.  In one grimy hand he carried a small demijohn.
Arriving opposite Caleb, he lifted his battered hat and
bowed low as a courtier would do.
</p>

<p>
"Glory be!  It's find ye alone I do," he spoke in rich
Irish brogue.  "It's trill ye a chune I did from the copse,
yonder, so's to soften the hard heart of ye, Caleb.  It's
dhry I am as a last-year's chip, an' me little jug do be
pinin' fer a refillin'."
</p>

<p>
Caleb's face grew stern.  "I told you, Harry O'Dule,
that I'd give you no more liquor," he replied.
</p>

<p>
"Faith, maybe ye did.  But last night it's the skies
thimselves said 'rain,' an' begorry! there's been not a
sign av a shower t'day.  What matters ut fer the fallin'
av an idle wurrud now and thin?  It's meself knows you're
too tinder hearted t' refuse a small favor to a body that
feels only love an' respect fer yourself an' the swate ones
who wait ye in the flower-covered cottage, beyont."
</p>

<p>
"Stop your blarney, Harry.  I tell you I'll give you
no more whisky, and by ding! that goes!"
</p>

<p>
"Thin I'll be trudgin' back along the way," said
O'Dule, hopelessly.  "But afore I go, I'll be liltin' ye a
small chune that'll mebee make ye understand somethin'
av a sadness yer generosity could lessen.  Listen thin!"
</p>

<p>
He set the jug down, and from his bosom drew forth a
tin whistle.  For a minute or two he played softly, his
eyes on Caleb's.  Then, gradually, his eyes closed and a
rapt expression settled upon his grimy face as he led his
listener down strange by-paths of fancy.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, Caleb jumped from the bench.  "Stop, Harry
O'Dule!" he entreated.  "That whistle of yours would
soften the heart of old Nick himself.  Do you want to set
me crazy, man?  Come, give me your jug, I'll fill it this
time.  But remember, never ag'in.  I mean that, by ding!"
</p>

<p>
He snatched up the demijohn and went into the store.
Old Harry sat down on the bench and waited until he
returned.
</p>

<p>
"It's a good fri'nd ye've been t' me, Caleb," he said
gratefully, as he lifted the jug and held it between his
knees.  "It's do widout me dhrink I cannot.  Ut an' me
whistle are me only gleams av sunlight in the gloom.  I'll
be after takin' a little flash of the light now, if ut's no
objection ye have, for ut's long dhry I've been."  He
lifted the jug and took a long draught of its fiery contents.
</p>

<p>
"I'll be movin' now," he said, as he wiped his mouth
on a tattered sleeve.  "God kape you safe, Caleb Spencer,
an' may yer whisky-barrel niver run dhry."
</p>

<p>
And placing his battered hat jauntily on his scanty
locks, Harry picked up his jug and was lost amid the
shadows.
</p>

<p>
Presently Billy Wilson emerged from the cottage,
received his basket from Caleb, and trotted off toward the
Keeler place.

CHAPTER VI
<br /><br />
THE RUSE THAT FAILED
</h3>

<p>
Out behind the wood-shed Maurice Keeler, by the dim
light of a smoky lantern, was splitting kindling for the
morning's fire when something clammy and twisting
dropped across the back of his neck.
</p>

<p>
"Holy Smoke!  Bill, take it away!" he yelled, as his
chum's laugh fell on his ears.
</p>

<p>
"Gosh! you ain't got no nerve a'tall, Maurice!  It's
only a milk-snake.  I picked it up on my way home from
the store.  I'm goin' to put it in the menagerie."
</p>

<p>
Maurice sat down weakly on a block and wiped his face
on his sleeve.
</p>

<p>
"Hang it all, Bill!" he complained, "what do you see
in snakes to make you want'a handle 'em so?  I'm scared
to death of 'em; I own it."
</p>

<p>
"I s'pose this feller an' ol' Spotba'll fight to a finish,"
said Billy, "but I aim to keep one snake of each kind, so
let 'em scrap it out.  It won't hurt that old womper to get
a good drubbin' anyway."
</p>

<p>
He held the newly captured snake along his arm, its
head resting in the palm of his hand.  The dim light was
sufficiently strong for Maurice to note the cold gleam in
its eyes, and he shuddered.  "Some day you'll try your
monkey-shines on a puff-adder er a black-snake," he prophesied,
"an' then you'll wish you hadn't gone clean crazy."
</p>

<p>
Billy grinned and dropped the snake into his jacket
pocket.  "I brought your Ma's groceries," he said.  "Is
she in the house?"
</p>

<p>
"Yep; she's cannin' thimble-berries.  Jest wait till I
get an armful of kindlin', an' I'll go in with you."
</p>

<p>
Billy put the basket down again.  "Say, what did she
want with all that hoarhound candy?" he asked curiously.
</p>

<p>
Maurice chuckled.  "Why, Missis Spencer told her what
great stuff it was to use in doin' up thimble-berries; sorta
takes the flat taste off 'em.  So Ma, she's goin' to try it."
</p>

<p>
Billy whistled.  "But fifty sticks, Maurice!  It's almost
more'n she'll need, don't you think?"
</p>

<p>
"'Course it's a lot too much.  S'pose we try on' get hold
of some of it, Bill?"
</p>

<p>
"Suits me," agreed Billy, "but jest how?  That's the
question."
</p>

<p>
Maurice stooped and filled his arms with a load of
kindling.  "I dunno how," he replied, "but you usually
find out a way fer everythin'.  What's the matter with
you lettin' on you lost part of that candy?"
</p>

<p>
Billy shook his head.  "No good, she'd be onto us
bigger'n a barn.  Tell you what we might do.  We might
take bad colds an' sorta work on her sympathies."
</p>

<p>
"Humph! an' be kept close in the house fer a week er
so, an' have to take physic an' stuff.  No good, Bill!"
</p>

<p>
"No, ours won't be them kind of colds," Billy
explained.  "They'll be the dry-cough, consumption kind,
that either cure up quick er slow.  All we gotta do is dig
up an Injun turnip out o' the bush an' nibble it.  It'll
pucker our throats up so tight we'll be hoarse enough to
sing bass in the choir."
</p>

<p>
Maurice let his kindling fall.  "Gee!" he exclaimed,
"I've got a piece of Injun turnip in my pocket right now.
Ain't that lucky!"
</p>

<p>
"How'd you come to have it?"
</p>

<p>
"Dug it up to fool Fatty Watland with.  Was goin' to
tell him it was a ground-nut.  I've had it in fer him ever
since he shoved me off the bridge into the creek."
</p>

<p>
"Let's have it."
</p>

<p>
Billy took the Indian turnip from his chum and with
his knife scraped off a portion of white, pungent pulp.
"Now then, put this on the back of your tongue, an' leave
it there," he directed.
</p>

<p>
Maurice grimaced as he licked the bit of pulp from the
knife blade.  "'Course we both know this danged thing is
pisin," he said, uncertainly.  "Maybe we're fools, Bill?"
</p>

<p>
"There's no maybe about it, far's you're concerned.
Do as I tell you; slide it 'way back so's it'll tighten your
throat.  That's right," as Maurice heroically obeyed.
"Now, let's get up to the house."
</p>

<p>
"But you haven't took yourn!" cried Maurice.
</p>

<p>
"Don't need to take mine," Billy informed him.
"What's the use of me takin' any; ain't one bad cough
enough?"
</p>

<p>
Maurice squirmed in torture.  Already the burning wild
turnip was getting in its work.  His throat felt as though
it were filled with porcupine quills.  He tried to voice a
protest against the injustice Billy had done him but it
ended in a wheeze.
</p>

<p>
"Fine," commended Billy.  "A cold like that oughta
be good fer half the hoarhound, anyway.  Let's go in afore
the thing wears off.  You take the basket, I'll carry the
kindlin' fer you."
</p>

<p>
He led the way to the house, Maurice following meekly
with the market-basket, eyes running tears and throat
burning.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Keeler was bending over a kettle on the stove, from
which the aroma of wild thimble-berries came in fragrant
puffs.
</p>

<p>
"So you're back at last, are you?" she addressed Billy,
crossly.  "Thought you'd never come.  I've been waitin'
on that sugar an' stuff fer two hours er more.  Now, you
go into the pantry and get somethin' to eat, while I unpack
this basket.  I know you must be nigh starved."
</p>

<p>
"Had my supper," shouted Billy.  He threw the
kindling into the wood box and grinned encouragement at
Maurice, who had sunk miserably down on a stool.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Keeler lifted the basket which Maurice had placed
on the floor at his feet.  "What's the matter with you?"
she asked, giving him a shake.
</p>

<p>
Maurice looked up at her with tear-filled eyes, and tried
to say something.  The effort was vain; not a sound issued
from his swollen lips.  Billy promptly advanced to give
first aid.
</p>

<p>
"Maurice's sick," he shouted in the deaf woman's ear.
</p>

<p>
"Sick?  Where's he sick?"  Mrs. Keeler lifted the
basket to the table and coming back to Maurice, put a
berry-stained finger under his chin.  "Stick out your
tongue!" she commanded.  "Billy, you fetch that lamp
over here."
</p>

<p>
Maurice opened his mouth and protruded his stained
and swollen tongue.
</p>

<p>
"Good gracious!" cried the mother, in alarm.  "That
good fer nuthin' boy has gone an' caught the foot an'
mouth disease from Kearnie's sheep."
</p>

<p>
"It's jest a bad cold he's caught," Billy reassured her.
"He's so hoarse he can't speak."
</p>

<p>
"Well, it might as well be one thing as another,"
frowned the woman.  "That boy catches everythin' that
comes along, anyway.  I s'pose I'll have to quit my
preservin' to mix him up a dose of allaways."
</p>

<p>
Maurice shivered and gazed imploringly at Billy.
</p>

<p>
"If you had somethin' sweet an' soothin' to give him,"
Billy suggested.  "Pine syrup, er hoarhound, er somethin'
like that, now&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Why, maybe you're right," agreed Mrs. Keeler, "an'
I do declare!  I've got some hoarhound right here in this
basket.  Ain't it lucky I sent fer it?"
</p>

<p>
The boys exchanged glances.  The scheme was working!
Mrs. Keeler went back to the basket on the table and started
to remove the packages, one by one.
</p>

<p>
Billy addressed his chum in tones so low the deaf woman
could not hear.  "Now, maybe you'll think I know what
I'm doin'," he commenced, then jumped guiltily, as a cry
of indignation came from the other side of the room.
Mrs. Keeler was untying the parcels, one after another, and
emptying their contents in the basket.  Billy stared.  Each
of the parcels contained&mdash;<i>sawdust</i>.
</p>

<p>
She turned slowly, stern eyes looking above her glasses
straight into his startled and apprehensive ones.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" she said ominously, "I s'pose you think
you've played a smart trick, you young limb!"
</p>

<p>
Billy tried to say something.  His lips moved dumbly.
Moisture gathered between his shoulder blades, condensed
as it met cold fear, and trickled in tiny rivulets down his
shivering spine.
</p>

<p>
He glanced at the door.  Mrs. Keeler's square form
interposed itself staunchly between him and that means of exit.
His wild eyes strayed to the face of his chum.  Maurice
was grinning a glad, if swollen, grin.  There was nothing
to do but face the music.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Keeler was advancing towards him now; advancing
slowly like some massed avenging force of doom.  "I
didn't do that," he finally managed to articulate.  "I
didn't play no trick on you, Missus Keeler."
</p>

<p>
His knees knocked together.  Unconsciously, his hand
felt gropingly back toward the wood-box in search of some
kind of support.  Mrs. Keeler's deafness was accountable
for her misunderstanding of his words.  She brought her
advance to a halt and stood panting.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't play no trick on you," Billy repeated.
</p>

<p>
"I heard you the first time," panted the indignant
woman.  "You said if I teched you you'd <i>take a stick to
me</i>.  So you'd commit murder on a woman who has been
a second mother to you, would you!  You'd brain me with
a stick out of that wood-box!  Oh!  Oh!"  She lifted her
apron and covered her face.
</p>

<p>
In a moment Billy was beside her.  "Oh Missus Keeler,"
he pleaded, miserably.  "I didn't say that.  Don't think
I'd do anythin' to hurt you, 'cause I wouldn't.  An' I
wouldn't play no dirty trick on you.  You've been good
to me an' I think a heap o' you, even if you do cuff me
sometimes.  Mr. Spencer put up that basket himself while
I was over to the cottage, gittin' my supper."
</p>

<p>
Slowly the apron was lowered.  Slowly the woman's
hands dropped to Billy's shoulders and she gazed into his
uplifted eyes.  Then she did a thing which was quite
characteristic of her.  She bent and gave each of the wide grey
eyes upraised to hers a resounding kiss.  Then, roughly
pushing him away, she reached for her shawl and hat
hanging on the wall.
</p>

<p>
"You boys stay right here and keep fire under that
kettle," she commanded.  "I'm goin' to take that old
Caleb Spencer's sawdust back to him an' give him a piece
of my mind."  And picking up the basket she went out,
banging the door behind her.
</p>

<p>
The boys gazed at each other and Maurice's chuckle
echoed Billy's, although it was raspy and hoarse.
</p>

<p>
"Throat burnin' yet?" inquired Billy.
</p>

<p>
"You bet," Maurice managed to answer.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you go along to the milkhouse an' lick the cream
off a pan of milk.  It'll settle that Injun turnip quick."
</p>

<p>
Maurice scooted for the back door.  He returned in a
little while with white patches of cream adhering to chin
and nose.  "Gosh!" he sighed gratefully, "that was
soothin'."
</p>

<p>
"What dye s'pose made Caleb Spencer put up that job
on me?" questioned Billy.  "I never fooled him any.  I
did cut some letters on his new bench, but he needn't feel
so sore at that."
</p>

<p>
"Well, jest you wait till Ma asks him why he did it,"
laughed Maurice, who now was almost normal again.
"Ma's great on gettin' explanations, she is."
</p>

<p>
Billy went down into his pocket and drew forth a furry
object about the size of a pocket knife and held it under
his chum's eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Gollies!" exclaimed Maurice.  "It's your rabbit foot
charm.  Where d'you find it, Bill?"
</p>

<p>
"Found it this mornin' down by the pine grove near
old Scroggie's ha'nted house.  Stood on this side of the
creek an' sent ol' Moll into the grove.  She brought it to
me.  She's a great little dog, Moll.  Now we're ready to
hunt ol' Scroggie's buried money an' lost will."
</p>

<p>
"What!  Tonight?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure.  Do you want somebody else to stumble on it
first?  We've gotta hunt tonight an' every night till we
find it, that's all."
</p>

<p>
"But we can't go now.  I dassent leave them preserves.
If I do Ma'll skin me.  Anyways, ain't we goin' to let
Elgin an' Fatty in on it, Bill?"
</p>

<p>
"Naw, you know what they'd do.  They'd let the cat
out o' the bag sure.  They're all right fer light work sech
as swipin' watermelon an' helpin' make a seine-haul but
they ain't no good at treasure an' will huntin'."
</p>

<p>
"Maybe you're right," Maurice said, "but I'm goin' t'
tell you I ain't feelin' any too much like prowlin' 'round
that ha'nted house this night er any other night."
</p>

<p>
Billy pushed his friend into a chair and stood before
him.  "Now look here, Scarecat," he said, "you're goin'
to help me find that money an' will, an' I'll tell you why.
You know what happened to Mr. Stanhope, the teacher,
don't you?  He's gone blind an' has had to give up
teachin' the school, hasn't he?"
</p>

<p>
Maurice nodded, his face grave.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what kind of a feller is he, anyway?  Come,
answer up."
</p>

<p>
"He's a mighty fine feller," cried Maurice enthusiastically.
</p>

<p>
"You're right, he is.  Well, what's he goin' to do now?
He can't work, kin he?"
</p>

<p>
"Gollies, no.  I never thought&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
"Well, it's time you did think.  Now you know that ol'
Scroggie left him everythin' he owned, don't you?"
</p>

<p>
"'Course I do."
</p>

<p>
"Only he can't prove it, kin he?"
</p>

<p>
"No!  Not without the will."
</p>

<p>
"Well, then?"  Billy sat down on a corner of the
table and eyed his friend reproachfully.
</p>

<p>
Maurice squirmed uneasily, then he said: "'Course, Bill,
it's up to you an' me to find that will.  But I'll be shot
if I'd do what we'll have to do fer anybody else in the
world but him."
</p>

<p>
"Say, here's a piece of news fer you," cried Billy.
"We're goin' to get ol' Harry O'Dule to help us.  He's
the seventh son of a seventh son.  We're goin' over to his
cabin to see him tonight."
</p>

<p>
"Gee!  Bill, we oughta find it if we get Harry to help,
but I can't see how I'm goin' to get away," said Maurice
ruefully.
</p>

<p>
Just here a step sounded on the gravel outside and a
knock fell on the door.  Maurice opened the door and in
stepped Anson.
</p>

<p>
He glanced suspiciously from one to the other of the
boys, then said: "Ma sent me to see what happened to
you, Bill.  She says come on home to your supper."
</p>

<p>
"Had my supper," Billy informed him.  "You go on
back and tell Ma that."
</p>

<p>
"You've gotta come, too."
</p>

<p>
"No, Anse, I promised Missus Keeler that me an' Maurice
would keep fire under that preservin' kettle till she gits
back from the store.  I need the ten cents to buy fish
hooks with, besides&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
"Gee!  Bill, is she goin' to give you ten cents fer helpin'
Maurice keep fire on?" asked Anson eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, she didn't 'zactly promise she would, but&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Say, fellers, let me stay with you an' we'll split three
ways, eh?" suggested Anson.
</p>

<p>
"No," said Billy, with finality.
</p>

<p>
"'Tain't enough fer a three-way split," said Maurice.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you can't hinder me from stayin', an' I figger
I'm in fer a third," said Anson, seating himself doggedly
near the stove.
</p>

<p>
Billy's face cracked into a grin which he was careful to
turn from his step-brother.  "How'd you like to do all
the firin' an' get all the reward, Anse?" he suggested.
"I've got a milk-snake here that I want'a get put safe
away in the root-house afore Ma takes in the lantern.
Maurice'll come along an' help me stow him away."
</p>

<p>
"All right, I'll stay an' fire," agreed Anson.  "But
remember," as the other boys reached for their hats, "I
ain't agoin' to share up what Missus Keeler gives me with
you fellers."
</p>

<p>
"You're welcome to keep all she gives you fer yourself,"
said Billy.
</p>

<p>
"Sure," said Maurice.  "She'll likely hold somethin'
back fer me, anyway.  Don't ferget to keep a good fire on,
Anse," he admonished, as he followed Billy outside.

CHAPTER VII
<br /><br />
THE RABBIT FOOT CHARM
</h3>

<p>
The place which old Harry O'Dule called home was a
crumbling log cabin on the shore of Levee Creek, just on
the border of the Scroggie bush.  Originally it had been
built as a shelter for sheep, but with the clearing of the
land it had fallen into disuse.  O'Dule had found it on
one of his pilgrimages and had promptly appropriated it
unto himself.  Nobody thought of disputing his possession,
perhaps because most of the good people of Scotia inwardly
feared the old man's uncanny powers of second sight, and
the foreshadowing&mdash;on those who chose to cross him&mdash;of
dire evils, some of which had been known to materialize.
Old Harry boasted that he was the seventh son of a
seventh son.
</p>

<p>
"It's born under a caul was I," he told them.  "An'
minny a mystery has been cleared up in ould Ireland be
meself, I'm tellin' ye."
</p>

<p>
At which some laughed and some scoffed.  Deacon
Ringold had sternly advised the old man to return to the
country where black magic was still countenanced, as there
was no place for it in an enlightened and Christian
community such as Scotia, a suggestion that old Harry took
in seeming good humor.  But the fact that the deacon lost
two milk cows and four hogs, through sickness during the
fortnight which followed, had caused considerable
discussion throughout the settlement.
</p>

<p>
O'Dule had cut a window in the cabin, installed an old
stove, table and chairs, and succeeded in making the place
home-like enough to suit his simple taste.  To-night he stood
by the stove, frying potatoes and humming an Irish song.
On the table lay a loaf of bread and some butter in a
saucer, while close beside it a coal oil lamp gave a smoky
light to the room.  In the center of the table reposed a
huge blue-grey cat, its amber eyes on Harry and its
forepaws curled contentedly beneath its furry breast.  All
about the room hung the skins of wild animals&mdash;deer,
bear, lynx and coon.  A pile of skins lay in one corner.
This was O'Dule's bed.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Och!  Billy O'Shune can't ye whistle t' me,<br />
  Av the gurril ye loved on the Isle 'cross the sea&mdash;<br />
  Shure it's weary I am av that drear, sorry song<br />
  So stop liltin', through tears, wid a visage so long&mdash;<br />
  Come, it's me ears a glad ditty would hear&mdash;<br />
  Av love 'neath th' skies av ould Ireland, dear&mdash;<br />
  Come, let us be glad&mdash;both togither, me lad&mdash;<br />
  There's good fish in the sea as has iver been had&mdash;<br />
  &mdash;Och, Billy O'Shune&mdash;<br />
  That's not much av a chune."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
So hummed old Harry as he stirred the potatoes and
wet his vocal chords, occasionally, from the jug at his feet.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly a knock fell on the door.
</p>

<p>
"In ye come," invited the Irishman and there entered
Billy and Maurice.
</p>

<p>
"Sit ye down, lads, sit ye down," cried the hospitable
Harry.  "Begobs, but it's a fine brace av byes ye are, an'
no mistake.  Wull ye be afther suppin' a bit wid me?
The repast is all but spread an' it's full welcome ye are,
both."
</p>

<p>
"We've had our supper," said Billy.  "Thought we'd
like to see you fer a minute er two, Harry," he added
gravely, as he and his chum seated themselves.
</p>

<p>
"Alone," said Maurice, significantly.
</p>

<p>
"Faith an' ain't I alone enough to suit ye?" laughed
Harry.  "Would ye have me put the cat out, thin?  Now,
phwat is ut?"
</p>

<p>
The boys glanced at each other.  "You tell him,"
whispered Billy, but Maurice shook his head.  "No, you," he
whispered back.
</p>

<p>
Billy braced himself and took a long breath.  "We've
made up our minds t' find old man Scroggie's will," he
said.
</p>

<p>
"An' money," said Maurice.  "We want you to help
us, Harry."
</p>

<p>
"God love us!" ejaculated Harry, dropping the knife
with which he was stirring the potatoes and reaching for
the demijohn.  "An' fer why should ye be out on that
wild goose chase, now?"
</p>

<p>
"'Cause we want Teacher Stanhope to have what
belongs to him," said Billy warmly.
</p>

<p>
"Do ye now?  God love him but that was a hard slap
in th' face he got fer playin' the man's part, so ut was.
Only this night did I say as much to Caleb Spencer.  Ut's
meself would like t' see him get what was his by rights,
byes."
</p>

<p>
"We knew that," cried Billy, eagerly; "that's why we
come to you, Harry.  You say you've found buried treasure
in Ireland; won't you help us find the lost will an'
money?"
</p>

<p>
O'Dule transferred the potatoes from the frying pan to
a cracked plate.  He sat down at the table and ate his
supper without so much as another word.  The boys
watched him, fear in their hearts that the eccentric old
Irishman would refuse their request.
</p>

<p>
After a time Harry pushed his stool back from the table.
"Byes," he said, producing a short black pipe from his
pocket.  "It's lend ye a spade and lantern I'll do an'
gladly; but it's yerselves would surely not be axin' me t'
test me powers ag'in a spirrut.  Listen now.  Old Scroggie's
ghost do be guardin' his money, wheriver it lies.
That you know as well as me.  It's frank I'll be wid ye,
an' tell ye that ag'in spirruts me powers are as nuthin'.
An' go widin the unholy circle av the ha'nted grove to
do favor t' aither man 'er divil I'll not."
</p>

<p>
"But think of what it means to him," urged Billy.
"Besides, Harry, I've got a charm that'll keep ol'
Scroggie's ghost away," he added, eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"An' phwat is ut?"  Old Harry's interest was real.
He laid his pipe down on the table and leaned towards
Billy.
</p>

<p>
"It's the left hind foot of a grave-yard rabbit," said
Billy, proudly exhibiting the charm.
</p>

<p>
O'Dule's shaggy brows met in a frown.  "Ut's no good
a'tall, a'tall," he said, contemptuously.  "Ut's not aven a
snake-bite that trinket wud save ye from, let alone a ghost."
</p>

<p>
Billy felt his back-bone stiffen in resentment.  Then he
noted that the milk snake, which he had thought snugly
asleep in his coat pocket, had awakened in the warmth of
the little cabin and slipped from the pocket and now lay,
soiled and happy, beneath the rusty stove.  He saw his
opportunity to get back at O'Dule for his scoffing.
</p>

<p>
"All right, Harry," he said airily, "if that's all you
know about charms, I guess you haven't any that 'ud help
us much.  But let me tell you that rabbit-foot charm kin
do wonders.  It'll not only keep you from bein' bit by
snakes but by sayin' certain words to it you kin bring a
snake right in to your feet with it, an' you kin pick it up
an' handle it without bein' bit, too."
</p>

<p>
"Och, it's a brave lad ye are, Billy bye," Harry
wheezed, "an' a brave liar, too.  Go on wid yer nonsense,
now."
</p>

<p>
"It's a fact, Harry," backed Maurice.
</p>

<p>
"Fact," cried O'Dule, angrily now.  "Don't ye be
comin' to me, a siventh son av a siventh son, wid such
nonsinse.  Faith, if yon worthless rabbit-fut kin do phwat ye
claim, why not prove ut t' me now?"
</p>

<p>
"An' if we do," asked Billy eagerly, "will you agree
to use your power to help us find the money an' will?"
</p>

<p>
"That I'll do," assented Harry, unhesitatingly.  "Call
up yer snake an' handle ut widout bein' bit, an' I'll help
ye."
</p>

<p>
"All right, I'll do it," said Billy.  "Jest turn the lamp
down a little, Harry."
</p>

<p>
"Me hands are a bit unsteady," said Harry, quickly.
"We'll l'ave the light be as ut is, Billy."
</p>

<p>
"It ought'a be dark," protested Billy, "but I'll try it
anyway."  He lifted the rabbit foot to his face and
breathed some words upon it.  Then in measured tones he
recited:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Hokey-pokey Bamboo Brake&mdash;<br />
  Go an' gather in a snake&mdash;'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Slowly Billy lowered the charm and looked at Harry.
The old man sat, puffing his short pipe, a derisive grin on
his unshaven lips.
</p>

<p>
"It's failed ye have, as I knowed ye wud," he chuckled.
"Ye best be lavin' now, both av ye, wid yer pranks."
</p>

<p>
"But," said Billy quickly, "the charm did work.  It
brought the snake, jest as I said it would."
</p>

<p>
"Brought ut?  Where is ut, thin?"  Harry sat up
straight, his little eyes flashing in fright.
</p>

<p>
"It's under the stove.  See it?"
</p>

<p>
Harry bent and peered beneath the stove.  "Be the
scales av the divil!" he shivered, "is ut a big, mottled
snake I see, or have I got what always I feared I might
get some day.  Is ut the D.T.'s I've got, I wonder?  How
come the reptile here, anyhow, byes?"
</p>

<p>
"You told me to bring it in, didn't you?" Billy
inquired, mildly.
</p>

<p>
"Yis, yis, Billy.  But hivins! ut's little did I think that
cat-paw av a charm had such power," groaned the wretched
Irishman.  "Ut's yourself said ut would let you handle
reptiles widout bein' bit.  Thin fer the love ov hivin pluck
yon serpent from beneath the stove an' hurl ut outside into
the blackness where ut belongs."
</p>

<p>
Billy arose and moving softly to the stove picked up the
harmless milk snake, squirming and protesting, from the
warm floor.  O'Dule watched him with fascinated eyes.
The big cat had risen and with back fur and tail afluff
spit vindictively as Billy passed out through the door.
</p>

<p>
When he returned O'Dule was seated on the edge of the
table, his feet on a stool.  He was taking a long sup from
the demijohn.
</p>

<p>
"Well, do you believe in my charm now?" Billy asked.
</p>

<p>
"I do," said Harry unhesitatingly.
</p>

<p>
"An' you'll help us, as you promised?"
</p>

<p>
"Did ye iver hear av Harry O'Dule goin' back on a
promise?" said the old man, reproachfully.  "Help you
wull I shurely, an' I'll be tellin' ye how.  Go ye over t' the
corner, Billy, an' pull up the loose board av the flure.
Ye'll be findin' a box there.  Yis, that's right.  Now fetch
ut here.  Look ye both, byes."
</p>

<p>
Harry lifted the little tin box to his knees and opened
it.  From it he brought forth a conglomeration of articles.
There were queer little disks of hammered brass and copper,
an egg-shaped object that sparkled like crystal in the
lamplight, a crotch-shaped branch of a tree.  As he handled
those objects tenderly the old man's face was tense and
he mumbled something entirely meaningless to the watchers.
Finally, with an exclamation of triumph, he brought forth
a piece of metal the size and shape of an ordinary lead
pencil.
</p>

<p>
"Look ye," he cried, holding it aloft.  "The fairies'
magic arrer, ut is, an' ut niver fails t' fall on the spot
where the treasure lies hidden.  Foind Scroggie's buried
money ut would have long ago if ut wasn't fer the ould
man's spirrut that roams the grove.  As I told ye afore,
ut's no charm ag'in the spirruts av the departed, as yon
grave-yard rabbit's fut is."
</p>

<p>
"But with the two of 'em," cried Billy eagerly, "we
kin surely find the will, Harry."
</p>

<p>
"It's right true ye spake," nodded Harry.  "An'
mebbe sooner than we think.  An' ut's the young t'acher
wid the blindness that gets it all, ye say?"
</p>

<p>
"Ol' Scroggie left it all to him," said Billy.
</p>

<p>
"Begobs, so I've heard before."  Harry scratched his
head reflectively.
</p>

<p>
"Well, God love his gentle heart, ut's himself now'll
hardly be carin' phwat becomes o' the money, let alone
he gets possession av the thousand acre hardwoods, I'm
thinkin'," he said, fastening his eyes on Billy's face.  "I'd
be wishin' the young t'acher to be ginerous, byes."
</p>

<p>
"He will," cried Billy, "I know he will."
</p>

<p>
"Thin God bless him," cried Harry.  "Now grasp
tight t' yer rabbit fut, an' we'll be afther goin' on our
way t' tempt Satan, over beyant in the evil cedars."
</p>

<p>
Five minutes later the trio were out on the forest path,
passing in Indian file towards the haunted grove.  The
wind had risen and now swept through the great trees
with ghostly sound.  A black cloud, creeping up out of
the west, was wiping out the stars.  Throughout the forest
the notes of the night-prowlers were strangely hushed.
No word was spoken between the treasure-seekers until
the elm-bridged creek was reached.  Then old Harry
paused, with labored breath, his head bent as though
listening.
</p>

<p>
"Hist," he whispered and Billy and Maurice felt their
flesh creep.  "Ut's hear that swishin' av feet above, ye
do?  Ut's the Black troup houldin' their course 'twixt the
seared earth an' the storm.  The witches of Ballyclue, ut
is, an' whin they be out on their mad run the ghoste av
dead min hould wild carnival.  Ut'll be needin' that rabbit-fut
sure we wull, if the ha'nted grove we enter this night."

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
<br /><br />
LUCK RIDES THE STORM
</h3>

<p>
Beneath the shadow of the coming storm the forest
gloom deepened to velvet blackness.  Suddenly a tongue
of lightning licked the tree-tops and a crash of thunder
shattered the stillness.  A few heavy rain-drops spattered
on the branches above the heads of the waiting three.
Billy and Maurice, a strange terror tugging at their
heart-strings, waited for old Harry to give the word forward.
But Harry seemed to be in no great hurry to voice such
command.  Fear had gripped his superstitious soul and
the courage loaned him from the squat demijohn was fast
oozing away.
</p>

<p>
Above, the blue-white lightning zig-zagged and the boom
of the thunder shook the earth.  A huge elm shivered and
shrieked as if in agony as a darting tongue of flame
enwrapped it like a yellow serpent, splitting its heart in
twain.
</p>

<p>
Billy found himself, face down, on the wet moss.
Maurice was tugging at his arm.  The stricken tree had
burst into flame, beneath the ghostly light of which path,
creek and pine-grove stood out clear-limned as a cameo
against a velvet background.  Billy noted this as he sat
dazedly up.  He and Maurice were alone; old Harry had
vanished.
</p>

<p>
"He's gone," Maurice answered his chum's look.
"Took to his heels when the lightnin' struck that elm.
The shock knocked us both down.  He was gone when I
come to."
</p>

<p>
Billy grinned a wan grin and pressed his knuckles
against his aching eyes.  "So's my milk-snake," he said.
"Guess I spilled him out o' my pocket when I fell.  Gee! that
was a close call.  Say, Maurice, ain't it queer though?
I was feelin' mighty scared an' trembly afore that bolt
fell, but now I feel nervy enough to tackle any ghost.
How 'bout you?"
</p>

<p>
"By gosh! that's jest how I feel, Bill.  That lightnin'
knocked all the scare plumb out o' me.  I don't like these
no-rain sort of thunderstorms though," he added.
"They're always slashin' out when they're least
expected."
</p>

<p>
"Well, the lightnin' part of this un's about past us,
Maurice.  But the rain's comin'.  Guess that ol' elm's
done fer.  She's dead, though, else she wouldn't burn
like that.  By hokey!" he broke off, "will you look
here?"
</p>

<p>
He picked up something that glittered in the firelight,
and held it up for his chum's inspection.
</p>

<p>
"Old Harry's fairy arrer," gasped Maurice.  "Oh say,
Bill, ain't that lucky?  He must have lost it in his
scramble to get away."
</p>

<p>
"Likely.  Now I move we go right over into that
ha'nted grove.  What you say?"
</p>

<p>
Maurice swallowed hard, "I'm blame fool enough fer
anythin' since I got knocked silly by that bolt," he
answered, "so I'm game if you are."
</p>

<p>
"Watch out!" warned Billy, grasping him by the arm
and jerking him to one side, "that struck elm is goin'
to fall."  A rainbow of flame flashed close before the
boys, as the stricken tree crashed across the path,
hurling forth a shower of sparks as it came to earth.  Then
inky darkness followed and from the black canopy which
a moment ago had seemed to touch the tree tops the rain
fell in torrents.
</p>

<p>
"Bill, Oh Bill! where 'bouts are you?"  Maurice's voice
sounded muffled and far away to his chum's ears.
</p>

<p>
"I'm right here," he answered.
</p>

<p>
"Gollies!  but ain't it dark?  I can't see anythin' of you,
Bill."
</p>

<p>
"Ner me, either.  I guess we'll have to give up the
hunt fer t'night, Maurice.  Anyways, we don't know jest
how to work ol' Harry's fairy arrer."
</p>

<p>
"No, we'll have to find out.  Say, Bill, where 'bouts
is the path?"
</p>

<p>
"Gee! how am I to know; it's right here somewheres,
though."
</p>

<p>
"I guess I've found it, Bill.  Come over close, so's I
kin touch you, then we'll be movin' 'long.  Hully
gee! but I'm wet.  Got both them charms safe?"
</p>

<p>
"Right here in my two fists, Maurice."
</p>

<p>
"Well, hang to 'em tight till we get away from this
ha'nted grove.  Ghosts don't mind rain none&mdash;an' he's
liable t' be prowlin' out.  Say, can't y' whistle a bit, so's
it won't be so pesky lonesome?"
</p>

<p>
Billy puckered up his lips, but his effort was a failure.
"You try, Maurice," he said, "I can't jest keep the hole
in my mouth steady long enough t' whistle."
</p>

<p>
"Gosh! ain't I been trying," groaned Maurice.  "My
teeth won't keep still a'tall.  Maybe I won't be one glad
kid when we get out 'a here."
</p>

<p>
For half an hour they groped their way forward, no
further words passing between them.  The heavy roar of
the rain on the tree tops made conversation next to
impossible.  The darkness was so dense they were forced to
proceed slowly and pause for breath after bumping
violently against a tree or sapling.  They had been striving
for what seemed to both to be a long, long time to find the
clearing when Billy paused in his tracks and spoke: "It's
no use, Maurice.  We're lost."
</p>

<p>
Maurice sank weakly down against a tree trunk, and
groaned.
</p>

<p>
"I guess we've struck into the big woods," Billy
informed him.  "Anyways, the trees are gettin' thicker
the further we go."
</p>

<p>
"Gee!  Bill, there might be wolves an' bears in this
woods," said Maurice, fearfully.
</p>

<p>
"Sure there might but I guess all we kin do is take
our chance with 'em."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'd rather take a chance with a bear than a
ghost, wouldn't you Bill?"
</p>

<p>
"Betcha, I would.  Say Maurice," he broke out
excitedly, "there's a light comin' through the trees.  See
it?  It's movin'.  Must be somebody with a lantern."
</p>

<p>
"I see it," Maurice replied in guarded tones.  "Bill,
that light's comin' this way, sure as shootin'."
</p>

<p>
"Looks like it.  Wonder who it kin be?  Maybe
somebody lookin' fer us."
</p>

<p>
The two boys crouched down beside a great beech.  The
light, which had not been a great distance from them when
first sighted, was rapidly approaching.  Billy grasped his
chum's arm.  "Look," he whispered, "there's two of
'em."
</p>

<p>
"I see 'em," his friend whispered back.  "Gosh! looks
as though they're goin' to tramp right onto us."
</p>

<p>
However, the night-roamers of the forest did not walk
into them.  Instead they came very close to the boys and
halted.  The man who carried the lantern set it down on
the ground and spoke in gruff tobes to his companion, a
short, heavy-set man with a fringe of black beard on his
face.
</p>

<p>
"I tell you, Jack, we'll hide the stuff there.  It'll be
safe as a church."
</p>

<p>
"I say no, Tom," the other returned, surlily.  "It
won't be safe there.  Somebody'll be sure to find it."
</p>

<p>
The other man turned on him angrily.  "Who'll find
it?" he retorted.  "Don't be a fool, Jack.  You couldn't
pull anybody to that place with a loggin' chain.  It's the
safest spot in the world to hide the stuff, I tell ye.  Besides,
the boat orter be in in a few days, and we kin slip the
stuff to Cap. Jacques without the boss ever knowin' how
far we've exceeded his orders."
</p>

<p>
"All right," gruffly assented his companion, "if you're
so cock sure, it suits me all right.  Come on; let's get
out of this cussed woods.  Remember we've got some work
before us tonight."
</p>

<p>
The man named Tom picked up the lantern and moved
on, cursing the rain and the saplings that whipped his
face at every step.  His pal followed without a word.
</p>

<p>
The boys waited until the lantern's glow grew hazy
through the slackening rain, then they sprang up and
followed.  Three-quarters of an hour later the trees began
to thin.  Unwittingly the strangers had guided them into
the clearing.
</p>

<p>
As they reached the open the rain ceased altogether.
High above a few pale stars were beginning to probe
through the tattered clouds.  The men with the lantern were
rapidly moving across the stumpy fallow, towards the
causeway.
</p>

<p>
"Will we foller 'em, Bill?" asked Maurice eagerly.
</p>

<p>
Billy shook his head.  "I'd sort o' like to," he said,
slowly, "jest to find out what game they're up to, but I
guess if we know what's good fer us we'll go home an'
take off these wet duds.  Hard lookin' customers, wasn't
they?"
</p>

<p>
"Hard, I should say so!  I'll bet either one of 'em 'ud
murder a hull family fer ten cents.  Say, Bill, maybe
they're pirates; you heard what they said about a boat,
didn't you?"
</p>

<p>
"Yep, I heard, but they ain't pirates, 'cause they didn't
have no tattoo marks on 'em, er rings in their ears; but
whoever they are they're up to no good.  They're aimin'
to hide somethin' somewheres, but jest what it is an' where
they intend hidin' it there's no way of tellin'; so come on,
let's get movin'."
</p>

<p>
In silence they made their way across the clearing to
the road.  "Say, Bill," said Maurice, as they paused to rest
on the top rail of the fence, "do you 'spose we best tell
our dads about seein' them men?"
</p>

<p>
"Naw, can't you see if we told our dads that, they'd
want 'a know what you an' me was doin' out in Scroggie's
bush in the rain, at that hour of the night?  No siree, we
won't say a word 'bout it."
</p>

<p>
"Then s'posin' we try an' find out something 'bout 'em
fer ourselves, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Say, you give me a pain," cried Billy.  "Don't you
'spose we've got all we kin do ahead of us now?"
</p>

<p>
"Findin' Scroggie's money an' will, you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure.  Now shut up an' let's get home.  I expect Ma'll
be waitin' up to give me hail Columbia, an' I guess you
won't be gettin' any pettin' from yourn, either."
</p>

<p>
"I know what I'll be gettin' from mine, all right," said
Maurice, moodily.  "Say, Bill," he coaxed, "you come
along over by our place an' smooth things over fer me,
will you?  You kin do anythin' with Ma."
</p>

<p>
"No," said Billy, "I got to be movin' on."
</p>

<p>
"But I'll get an awful hidin' if you don't.  I don't
mind an ordinary tannin' but a tannin' in these wet pants
is goin' to hurt like fury.  They're stickin close to my legs.
I might as well be naked an' Ma she certainly does lay it
on."
</p>

<p>
Billy laughed.  "All right, I'll come along, but I ain't
believin' anythin' I kin say to your Ma'll keep you from
gettin' it."
</p>

<p>
The boys slid from the fence, then leaped back as
something long and white rose from behind a fallen tree and,
with a startled snort, confronted them.
</p>

<p>
"Gollies!" ejaculated Billy.  "It's a hog.  I thought,
first off, it was a bear."
</p>

<p>
Maurice peered out from behind a tree.  "Well, I'll be
jiggered!" he exclaimed.  "It's our old sow.  She's been
lost fer nigh onto two weeks, an' Dad's been huntin' fer her
everywhere."
</p>

<p>
"That so?  Then we'll drive her home."
</p>

<p>
"Aw, say, Bill," protested Maurice, "I'm tired an' wet
as a water-logged plank.  Let her go.  I'll tell Dad, an'
he kin come after her tomorrow."
</p>

<p>
"No, we'll drive her home now.  I guess I know what's
best.  Get on t'other side of her.  Now then, don't let her
turn back!"
</p>

<p>
Maurice grumblingly did his share of the driving.  It was
no easy task to pilot that big, rangy sow into the safe
harbor of the Keeler barnyard but done it was at last.
</p>

<p>
"Ma's got the light burnin' an' the strap waitin' fer
her little boy," chaffed Billy as they put up the barn-yard
bars.
</p>

<p>
Maurice, who had climbed the fence so as to get a glimpse
of the interior of his home through a window, whistled
softly as his eyes took in the scene within.
</p>

<p>
"Say, Billy," he cried, "your Ma an' Pa's there."
</p>

<p>
"Gee whitticker!" exclaimed Billy.  "I wish now I
hadn't promised you I'd come in.  All right, lead on.  Let's
get the funeral over with."
</p>

<p>
Without so much as another word the boys went up the
path.
</p>

<p>
"If I don't see you ag'in alive, Bill, good bye,"
whispered Maurice as he opened the door.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Keeler, who was doing her best to catch what her
neighbor was saying, lifted her head as the two wet and
tired boys entered the room.
</p>

<p>
"There they be now," she said grimly.  "The two worst
boys in Scotia, Mrs. Wilson."
</p>

<p>
"I believe you, Mrs. Keeler," nodded her friend.  "Now
then, where have you two drowned rats been tonight,
Willium?"
</p>

<p>
Cobin Keeler, who was playing a game of checkers with
Billy's father, cleared his throat and leaned forward like
a judge on the bench, waiting for the answer to his
neighbor's question.
</p>

<p>
"We got&mdash;&mdash;" commenced Maurice, but Billy pinched
his leg for silence.
</p>

<p>
"I got track of your lost sow, Mr. Keeler, when I was
comin' home from the store tonight," he said.  "Least-wise
I didn't know it was your sow but Maurice told me
about yours bein' lost.  So after Mrs. Keeler went to
give Mr. Spencer a call down we hired Anse to look after
the preservin' an' went out to try an' track her down."
</p>

<p>
Maurice, who had listened open mouthed to his chum's
narration, sighed deeply.  "We had an awful time," he
put in, only to receive a harder pinch for his pains.
</p>

<p>
"But you didn't see her, did ye?" Cobin asked eagerly.
</p>

<p>
Disregarding the question, Billy continued: "The
tracks led us a long ways, I kin tell you.  We got up into
the Scroggie bush at last an' then the rain come."
</p>

<p>
"But we kept right on trackin&mdash;" put in Maurice,
eagerly.  "After the stars come out again, of course,"
explained Billy, managing to skin Maurice's shin with his
boot-heel, "an' we found her&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You found her?" cried Cobin, leaping up.
</p>

<p>
"Jest half an hour ago," said Billy.
</p>

<p>
"Good lads!" cried Cobin heartily, "Ma, hear that?
They found ol' Junefly.  Wasn't that smart of 'em, an'
in all that rain, too."
</p>

<p>
"Who'd you say was agoin' to soon die?"  Mrs. Keeler
put her hand to her ear and leaned forward.
</p>

<p>
"I say the boys found the old sow, Ma!" Cobin shouted.
</p>

<p>
"They <i>did</i>?"  Mrs. Keeler turned towards Billy and
Maurice, her face aglow.  "An' was that what they was
adoin'?  Now I'm right sorry I spoke harsh.  I am so.
Ain't you, Mrs. Wilson?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I must say that Willium does do somethin' worth
while, once in a long while," returned her neighbor,
grudgingly.  "But Anson, now&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Keeler broke in.  "Anson, humph!  Why, that boy
had the nerve to say that I should give him ten cents fer
watchin' the kettle while them two dear boys was out in the
storm, huntin' fer Pa's sow.  I give him a box on the ear
instead an' sent him home on the jump.  Maybe I was a bit
hasty but I was mad after havin' to give that old Caleb
Spencer a piece of my mind fer sendin' me sawdust instead
of groceries.  I guess he won't try that ag'in."
</p>

<p>
Billy moved towards the door.  "I'd best be gettin'
home," he said, "I'm awful wet."
</p>

<p>
"Stay all night with Maurice," invited Mrs. Keeler.
"You an' him kin pile right into bed now and I'll bring
you both a bowl of hot bread and milk."
</p>

<p>
Billy glanced at his mother.
</p>

<p>
"You kin stay if your want to, Willium," she said,
"only see that you are home bright and early in the
mornin'.  Your Pa'll want you to help hill potaters."
</p>

<p>
She stood up.  "Well, Tom, if you and Cobin are through
with the game don't start another.  It's late an' time all
decent folks was home abed."
</p>

<p>
Snug in Maurice's corn-husk bed in the attic, the boys lay
and listened for the door to open and close.  Then Maurice
chuckled.
</p>

<p>
"Gee!  Bill, I could'a knocked your head off fer makin'
me help drive ol' Junefly home but now I see you knowed
what you was doin'.  Holy smoke!  I wish't I was as
smart as you."
</p>

<p>
"Go to sleep," said Billy drowsily.
</p>

<p>
Half an hour later when Mrs. Keeler carrying two bowls
of steaming bread and milk ascended the stairs Billy alone
sat up to reach for it.
</p>

<p>
"Is Maurice asleep?" whispered the woman.
</p>

<p>
Billy nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you might as well have both bowls then.  I don't
like to see good bread an' milk wasted."
</p>

<p>
She set the bowls down on the little table beside the bed,
placed the lamp beside them, then leaning over tucked the
blankets about the boys.
</p>

<p>
"No use tryin' to wake Maurice," she said as she turned
to go.  "As well try to wake the dead.  Remember, you
boys get up when I call you."

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
<br /><br />
MOVING THE MENAGERIE
</h3>

<p>
Billy and Maurice, taking the short cut to the Wilson
farm across the rain-drenched fields next morning, were
planning the day's programme.
</p>

<p>
"Now that we've got ol' Harry's charm along with my
rabbit-foot," Billy was saying, "we ought'a be able to
snoop 'round in the ha'nted grove an' even hunt through
the house any time we take the notion.  Maybe we'll get
a chance to do it to-day."
</p>

<p>
"But, darn it all, Bill," Maurice objected, "there won't
be no ghost to lead the way to the stuff in the daytime."
</p>

<p>
"Well, if we take a look over the place in daylight we'll
know the lay-out better at night, won't we?  Trigger Finger
Tim did that most times, an' he always got away clean.
Supposin' a ghost is close at your heels, ain't it a good idea
to have one or two good runways picked out to skip on?
We're goin' through that ha'nted house in daylight, so you
might as well make up your mind to that."
</p>

<p>
Maurice was about to protest further when the rattle of
loose spokes and the beat of a horse's hoofs on the hard
road fell on their ears.
</p>

<p>
"That's Deacon Ringold's buck-board," Billy informed
his chum, drawing him behind an alder-screened stump.
"Say, ain't he drivin'?  Somebody must be sick at his
place."  Then as the complaining vehicle swept into sight
from around the curve, "By crackey, Maurice, your Pa's
ridin' with him."
</p>

<p>
Maurice scratched his head in perplexity.  "Wonder
where he's takin' Dad?  It's too late fer sheep-shearin' an'
too early fer hog-killin'; an' that's 'bout all Dad's good
at doin', 'cept leadin' the singin' at prayer-meetin'.
Wonder what's up?  Gee! the deacon is sure puttin' his old
mare over the road."
</p>

<p>
"Keep quiet till they get past," cautioned Billy.  "Say! we
needn't have been so blamed careful about makin' our
sneak if we'd knowed your Pa was away from home."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, look, Bill," said Maurice, "they're stoppin' at
your place."
</p>

<p>
The deacon had pulled up at the Wilson's gate.  "He's
shoutin' fer Pa," Billy whispered, as a resounding "Hello,
Tom!" awoke the forest echoes.  "Come on Maurice, let's
work our way down along this strip o' bushes, so's we kin
hear what's goin' on."
</p>

<p>
The boys wriggled their way through the thicket of
sumach, and reached a clump of golden-rod inside the road
fence just as Wilson came out of the lane.
</p>

<p>
"Mornin', neighbors," he greeted the men in the
buckboard, "won't you pull in?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said the deacon, "we're on our way to Twin
Oaks, Thomas.  Thieves broke into Spencer's store last
night.  We're goin' up to see if we can be of any use to
Caleb.  We'd like you to come along."
</p>

<p>
Wilson's exclamation of surprise was checked by Cobin
Keeler, whose long arm reached out and encircled him.  He
was lifted bodily into the seat and the buckboard dashed
on up the road, the clatter of its loose spokes drowning the
loud voices of its occupants.
</p>

<p>
The boys eat up and stared at each other.
</p>

<p>
"You heard?" Billy asked in awed tones.
</p>

<p>
Maurice nodded.  "They said thieves at the store."  Forgotten,
for the moment, was old Scroggie's ghost and
the buried treasure in this new something which promised
mystery and adventure.
</p>

<p>
"Hully Gee!" whispered Billy.  "Ain't that rippin'."
</p>

<p>
"Ain't it jest?" agreed Maurice.  "Say, Bill, there
ain't no law ag'in shootin' robbers is there&mdash;store-robbers,
I mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Naw, why should there be?  That's what you're supposed
to do, if you get the chance&mdash;shoot 'em, an' get the
<i>re</i>ward."
</p>

<p>
"What's a <i>re</i>ward?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, it's money, you ninny!  You kill the robbers an'
you get the church collection an' lots of other money
besides.  Then you're rich an' don't ever have to do any
work; jest fish an' hunt an' give speeches at tea-meetin's
an' things."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, hokey! ain't that great.  How'd you come to know
all that, Bill?"
</p>

<p>
"Why I read it in Anson's book, 'Trigger-Finger Tim
er Dead er Alive.'  Oh, it's all hunky, I tell you."
</p>

<p>
"But, Bill, how we goin' to kill them robbers?"
</p>

<p>
"Ain't goin' to kill 'em," his friend replied.  "Trigger-Finger
Tim never killed his; he took 'em all alive.  All
he did was crease their skulls with bullets, an' scrape their
spines with 'em, an' when they come to they'd find
themselves tied hand an' foot, an' Trigger-Finger smokin' his
cigarette an' smilin' down on 'em."
</p>

<p>
"Gollies!" exulted Maurice.  Then uncertainty in his
tones, "A feller 'ud have to be a mighty good shot to do
that though, Bill."
</p>

<p>
"Oh shucks!  What's the use of thinkin' 'bout that
now?  We've gotta catch them robbers first, ain't we?"
</p>

<p>
"Yep, that's so.  But how?"
</p>

<p>
Billy wriggled free of the golden-rod.  "Come on over
an' help me move my menagerie an' we'll plan out a way."
</p>

<p>
They climbed the fence and crossed the road to the
lane-gate.
</p>

<p>
"Now, then," said Billy, "you scoot through the trees
to the root-house, while I go up to the kitchen an' sneak
some doughnuts.  Don't let Ma catch a glimpse of you er
she'll come lookin' fer me an' set me to churnin' er
somethin' right under her eyes.  An' see here," he warned, as
Maurice made for the trees, "don't you get to foolin'
with the snakes er owls, an' you best keep out of ol'
Ringdo's reach, 'cause he's a bad ol' swamp coon in some ways.
You jest lay close till I come back."
</p>

<p>
Whistling soundlessly, Billy went up the path to the
house.  He peered carefully in through the screened door.
The room was empty and so was the pantry beyond.  Billy
entered, tiptoed softly across to the pantry and filled his
pockets with doughnuts from the big crock in the cupboard.
Then he tip-toed softly out again.
</p>

<p>
As he rounded the kitchen, preparatory to a leap across
the open space between it and the big wood-pile, Mrs. Wilson's
voice came to him, high-pitched and freighted with
anger.
</p>

<p>
"You black, thievin' passel of impudence, you!" she
was saying.  "If I had a stick long enough to reach you,
you'd never dirty any more of my new-washed clothes."
</p>

<p>
On the top-most branch of a tall, dead pine, close beside
the wood-pile, sat the tame crow, Croaker, his head cocked
demurely on one side, as he listened to the woman's
righteous abuse.  Croaker could no more help filling his claws
with chips and dirt and wobbling the full length of a line
filled with snowy, newly-washed clothes than he could help
upsetting the pan of water in the chicken-pen, when he saw
the opportunity.  He hated anything white with all his
sinful little heart and he hated the game rooster in the same
way.  He was always in trouble with Ma Wilson, always
in trouble with the rooster.  Only when safe in the highest
branch of the pine was he secure, and in a position to talk
back to his persecutors.
</p>

<p>
He said something now, low and guttural, to the woman
shaking her fist at him in impotent anger.  His voice was
almost human in tone, his attitude so sinister that she
shuddered.  "That's right, swear at me, too," she cried, "add
insult to injury, you black imp!  If it wasn't fer bein'
scared of shootin' myself I'd get the gun an' shoot you, I
would so!"
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Croaker stretched himself erect.  A soft
whistle, so low as to be inaudible to the indignant woman
but clear to his acute ears, had sounded from the far side
of the wood pile.  Pausing only long enough to locate the
sound, Croaker spread his wings and volplaned down,
emitting a hoarse croak of triumph almost in Mrs. Wilson's
face, as he swept close above her.
</p>

<p>
"Come here, you," spoke a low voice as Croaker settled
on the other side of the wood pile, and the crow promptly
perched himself on Billy's shoulder with a succession of
throaty notes that sounded like crazy laughter, but which
were really expressions of unadulterated joy.  For this
boy who had taken him from the nest in the swaying elm
when he was nothing but a half-feathered, wide-mouthed
fledgling, and had fed him, cared for him, defended him
against cat, dog, rooster and human beings&mdash;for this
boy alone Croaker felt all the love his selfish heart was
capable of giving.
</p>

<p>
And now as Billy carried him towards the root-house he
recited the various adventures which had been his since
they had parted, recited them, it is true, in hoarse
unintelligible crow-language, but which Billy was careful to
indicate he understood right well.
</p>

<p>
"So you did all that, did you?" he laughed.  "Oh,
but you're a smart bird.  But see here, if you go on the
way you're doin', dirtyin' Ma's clean clothes an' abusin'
her like I heard you doin', your light's goin' out sudden
one of these days.  Ma's scared to shoot the ol' gun herself,
but she'll get Anse to do it.  I guess I better shut
you up on wash-mornin's after this."
</p>

<p>
"What's he been doin' now, Bill?" asked Maurice as
Billy and the crow joined him beside the root-house.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he's been raisin' high jinks with Ma ag'in,"
explained Billy.  "He will get his claws full o' dirt an'
pigeon-toe along her line of clean clothes, as soon as her
back's turned."
</p>

<p>
"Gosh! ain't he a terror?" Maurice exclaimed.  "Say,
why don't you put him in the menagerie?"
</p>

<p>
"Maurice, you've got about as much sense as a wood-tick,"
Billy replied in disgust.  "How long d'ye s'pose
my snakes an' bats an' lizards 'ud last if I turned Croaker
loose in there?"
</p>

<p>
"Pshaw!  Bill, he couldn't hurt Spotba, the womper,
could he?"
</p>

<p>
"Jest couldn't he?  I'll take you down to the marsh
some day an' show you how quick he kin kill a womper."
</p>

<p>
"Gollies!  Is that so?  Well he couldn't hurt the black
snake; that's one sure thing."
</p>

<p>
"No, it ain't, 'cause he kin kill a black snake a sight
easier than he kin a womper, an' I'll tell you why.
Black-snakes have got teeth.  They bite.  But their backbone is
easy broke.  A womper hasn't any teeth.  He strikes with
his bony nose.  You know what one of them snakes kin
do?  You saw that big one, down in Patterson's swamp
lay open Moll's face with one slash.  They're thick necked,
an' take a lot of killin'.  This crow kin kill a black-snake
with one slash of his bill.  He has to choke the womper to
death."
</p>

<p>
Maurice scratched his head thoughtfully.  "Say, you
know a lot about snakes an' things, don't you?" he said
admiringly.
</p>

<p>
"Maybe I do, but I ain't tellin' all I know," said Billy.
"What's the good?  Nobody 'ud believe me."
</p>

<p>
"What you mean, believe you?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, if I said I saw a fight between a little brown
water-snake no bigger'n a garter snake, an' a fish-hawk, an'
the snake licked the hawk, d'ye s'pose anyone 'ud believe
that?"
</p>

<p>
"I dunno.  Maybe, an' maybe not."
</p>

<p>
"Supposin' I said the snake <i>killed the hawk?</i>"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, gee whitticker! nobody 'ud believe that, Bill."
</p>

<p>
"There now.  Nobody 'ud believe it.  An' yet I saw it."
</p>

<p>
"You saw it?"  Maurice, who could not think of
questioning his chum's word, gasped in amazement.
</p>

<p>
"Yep, I saw it last spring&mdash;in the Eau rice beds, it
was.  I was tryin' to find a blue-winged teal's nest.  Saw
the drake trail off an' knowed the duck must be settin'
somewhere on the high land close beside the pond.  As I
was standin' still, lookin' about, this little water snake
come swimmin' 'cross a mushrat run.  Jest then I saw a
shadder cross the reeds, an' a fish-hawk swooped down an'
made a grab at the snake.  The snake dived an' come up
close to shore.  The hawk wheeled an' swooped ag'in.  This
time the water was too shallow fer snakie to get clear away.
The hawk grabbed him in his claws an' started up with
him.  'Goodbye, little snake,' I thought, an' jest then I
noticed that the hawk was havin' trouble; fer one thing,
he wasn't flyin' straight, an' he was strikin' with his
curved beak without findin' anythin'.  Pretty soon he
started saggin' down to the reeds.  I jumped into the punt
an' made fer the spot where I thought he'd come down.
Jest as I got there he splashed into the shallow water.  I
stood up in the punt, an' then I saw what had happened.
The little water-snake had coiled round the hawk's neck
an' had kept its head close under his throat.  You know
that a water snake has two little saw teeth, one on each
side of the upper jaw.  I've often wondered what good a
pair of teeth like that could be to 'em, but I don't any
more, 'cause that little snake had cut that hawk's throat
with them snags an' saved himself."
</p>

<p>
"An' so he got away!" sighed Maurice.
</p>

<p>
"Well, he should have, but I didn't let him.  I thought
I'd like to own a snake as plucky as that, so I caught
him&mdash;didn't have no trouble, he was awful tired&mdash;an' brought
him up here to the menagerie."
</p>

<p>
Maurice whistled.  "Gee!  Bill, you don't mean t' tell
me that water-snake you call Hawk-killer is him?"
</p>

<p>
"Yep, that's him.  Now," he cried tossing Croaker into
a tree, "I'll tell you what we gotta do.  We gotta move
these pets down to that old sugar-shanty in our woods.
Ma's got so nervous with havin' 'em here that I'm afraid
Anse might take it in his head to let 'em out, er kill 'em.
I've got 'em all boxed nice an' snug.  All I want you to do
is help me carry 'em.  We can do it in two trips.  Ringdo,
of course, 'll stay along up here.  Ma's not scared of him
like she is of the other things.  Come along."
</p>

<p>
He unpropped the root-house door and threw it open.
Maurice hesitated on the threshold, peering into the
darkness.
</p>

<p>
"Are you sure you've got 'em boxed safe, Bill?" he
asked, fearfully.
</p>

<p>
"Bet ye I am."
</p>

<p>
"Then, here's fer it, but I must say I'll be glad when
the job's done," shivered Maurice, following his chum into
the blackness of the root-house.
</p>

<p>
Croaker hopped to a lower branch and peered in after his
master.  Then, catching sight of a doughnut which had
spilled from Billy's pocket, he fluttered down to the ground,
and with many caressing croaks proceeded to make a meal
of it.

<h3>
CHAPTER X
<br /><br />
IN LOST MAN'S SWAMP
</h3>

<p>
The August days were passing swiftly, each fragrant
dawn marking another step towards that inevitable
something which must be faced&mdash;the reopening of the Valley
School by a new teacher.  Billy's heart saddened as the
fields ripened and the woods turned red and gold.  For
once his world was out of tune.  Maurice Keeler was sick
with measles and Elgin Scraff lay ill with the same disease.
Taking advantage of this fact, the Sand-sharkers had grown
bold, some of the more venturesome of them going even so
far as to challenge Billy to "knock the chip off their
shoulders."
</p>

<p>
Billy had not only accommodated the trouble-seekers in
this regard but had nearly knocked the noses off their
freckled faces as well, after which he had proceeded to
lick, on sight, each and every Sand-sharker with whom his
lonely rambles brought him in contact.  But his victories
lacked the old time zest.  He missed Maurice's "Gee!
Bill, that left swing to his eye was a corker"; missed
Elgin's offer to bet a thousand dollars that Billy Wilson
could lick, with one hand tied behind him, any two
Sand-sharkers that ever smelled a smoked herrin'.  Victory was
indeed empty of glory.  And so the glad days were sad
days for Billy.  It was an empty world.  What boy in
Billy's place would not have been low-spirited under like
conditions?  What boy would not have paused, as he was
doing now, to itemize his woes?
</p>

<p>
He was seated on a stump in the new clearing which
sloped to Levee Creek, fingers locked about one knee,
battered felt hat pulled over his eyes.  The green slope at his
feet lay half in the sunlight, half in the shadow.  Across
from a patch of golden-rod, the cock bird of a fox-scattered
quail-covey whistled the "All's Well" call to the birds
in hiding.  Ordinarily Billy would have answered that call,
would have drawn the brown, scuttling birds close about
him with the low-whistled notes he could produce so well:
but today he was oblivious to all save his thoughts.
</p>

<p>
Two weeks had passed since the robbery of the Twin
Oaks store and that which he and Maurice had planned to
do towards finding the Scroggie will and capturing the
thieves had, through dire necessity, been abandoned.
Sickness had claimed Maurice just when he was most needed.
For days Billy had lived a sort of trancelike existence;
had gone about acting queerly, refusing his meals and
paying little attention to anybody or anything.
</p>

<p>
It had become a regular thing for his father to say each
morning, "I guess you ain't feelin' up to much today,
Billy; so all you have to do is watch the gap and water
the cattle"; which was quite agreeable to Billy, because
it gave him an opportunity to be by himself.  Men who
sit in the shadow of irrevocable fate are always that way;
they want to be left alone&mdash;murderers on the eve of their
execution, captains on wrecked ships, Trigger Finger Tim,
who was to be shot at sunrise, but wasn't.
</p>

<p>
Billy wanted to shadow old Scroggie's ghost and so
discover the will; he wanted to seek out the robbers of the
Twin Oaks store and earn a reward; he wanted Maurice
Keeler with him; he wanted to hear Elgin Scraff's laugh.
But all this was denied him.  And now a new burden had
been thrust upon him, compared with which all his other
woes seemed trivial.  Old Scroggie's namesake and
apparent heir had turned up again.  Billy had seen him with
his own eyes; with his own ears had heard him declare
that he intended to erect a saw-mill in the thousand-acre
forest.  This meant that the big hardwood wonderland
would be wiped away and that Frank Stanhope would
never inherit what was rightfully his.
</p>

<p>
It seemed like an evil dream, but Billy knew it was no
dream.  Scroggie, astride a big bay horse, had passed him
while he was on his way to the store with a basket of eggs
for his mother, and he had pulled in at the store just as
Deacon Ringold had taken the last available space on the
customers' bench outside, and Caleb Spencer had come to
the door to peer through the twilight in search of the
Clearview stage, which was late.  Noticing the stranger
on horseback Caleb had hurried forward to ask how best
he could serve him.
</p>

<p>
Hidden safely behind a clump of cedars Billy had
watched and listened.  He had heard Scroggie tell the
storekeeper that he and his family had come to Scotia to stay
and that he intended to cut down the timber of the big
woods.  He had then demanded that Spencer turn over to
him a certain document which it seemed old man Scroggie
had left in Caleb's charge some months before his death.
Billy had seen Spencer draw the man a little apart from
the others, who had gathered close through curiosity, and
had heard him explain that the paper had been taken
from his safe on the night of the robbery of his store.
Scroggie had, at first, seemed to doubt Caleb's word; then
he had grown abusive and had raised his riding-whip
threateningly.  Here Billy, having heard and seen quite
enough, had acted.  Placing his basket gently down on
the sward he had picked up an egg and with the accuracy
born of long practice in throwing stones, had sent it
crashing into Scroggie's face.  Gasping and temporarily blinded,
Scroggie had wheeled his horse and galloped away.
</p>

<p>
But today Billy, musing darkly, knew that Scroggie
would do what he had said he would do.  The big woods
was his, according to law; he could do as he wished with
it, and he would wipe it out.
</p>

<p>
With a sigh, Billy slid from the stump and stood
looking away toward the east.  What would Trigger Finger
Tim do in his place?  When confronted by insurmountable
obstacles Trigger Finger had been wont to seek excitement
and danger.  That's what he, Billy, would do now.
But where was excitement and danger to be found?  Ah,
he knew&mdash;Lost Man's Swamp!
</p>

<p>
Billy's right hand went into a trouser's pocket; then
nervously his left dived into the other pocket.  With a
sigh of relief he drew out a furry object about the size
of a pocket-knife.
</p>

<p>
"Ol' Rabbit-foot charm," he said, aloud.  "I jest
might need you bad today."  Then he turned and walked
quickly across the fallow toward the causeway.
</p>

<p>
Some three miles east of the imaginary line which divided
the Settlement from the outside world, on the Lake Shore
road, stood a big frame house in a grove of tall walnut
trees.  It was the home of a man named Hinter&mdash;a man
of mystery.  Before it the lake flashed blue as a kingfisher's
wing through the cedars; behind it swept a tangle
of forest which gradually dwarfed into a stretch of
swamp-willow and wild hazel-nut bushes, which in turn gave place
to marshy bog-lands.
</p>

<p>
Lost Man's Swamp, so called because it was said that
one straying into its depths never was able to extricate
himself from its overpowering mists and treacherous
quicksands, was lonely and forsaken.  It lay like a
festering sore on the breast of the world&mdash;black, menacing,
hungry to gulp, dumb as to those mysteries and tragedies
it had witnessed.  It was whispered that the devil made
his home in its pitchy ponds, which even in the fiercest
cold of winter did not freeze.
</p>

<p>
For Billy, who knew and understood so well the sweeping
wilderness of silence and mysteries, this swamp held
a dread which, try as he might, he could not analyze.  On
one other occasion had he striven to penetrate it, but as if
the bogland recognized in him a force not easily set aside,
it had enwrapped him with its deadly mists which chilled
and weakened, torn his flesh with its razor-edged grass and
sucked at his feet with its oozy, dragging quicksands.  He
had turned back in time.  For two weeks following his
exploit he had lain ill with ague, shivering miserably, silent,
but thinking.
</p>

<p>
And now he was back again; and this time he did not
intend to risk his life in those sucking sands.  From a
couple of dead saplings, with the aid of wild grape-vines,
he fashioned a light raft which would serve as a support
in the bog, and carry his weight in the putrid mire beyond.
Strange sounds came to his ears as he worked his way
across the desolate waste toward the first great
pond&mdash;scurrying, rustling sounds of hidden things aroused from
their security.  Once a big grey snake stirred from torpor
to lift its head and hiss at him.  Billy lifted it aside with
his pole and went on.
</p>

<p>
Great mosquitoes whined about his head and stung his
neck and ears.  Mottled flies bit him and left a burning
smart.  The saw-like edges of the grass cut his hands and
strove to trip him as he pushed his improvised raft
forward.  Once his foot slipped on the greasy bog, and the
quicksands all but claimed him.  But he pushed on, reaching
at last the black sullen shallows, putrid and ill-smelling
with decayed growth, and alive with hideous insects.
</p>

<p>
Great, black leeches clung to the slimy lily-roots; water
lizards lay basking half in and half out of the water, or
crept furtively from under-water grotto to grotto.  And
there were other things which Billy knew were hidden from
his sight&mdash;things even more loathsome.  For the first
time in his life he experienced for Nature a feeling akin
to dread and loathing.  It was like a nightmare to him,
menacing, unreal, freighted with strange horrors.
</p>

<p>
One thing Billy saw which he could not understand.  The
greasy surface of the shallow pond was never still, but
bubbled incessantly as porridge puffs and bubbles when it
boils.  It was as if the slimy creatures buried in the oozy
bottom belched forth their poisonous breath as they stirred
in sleep.
</p>

<p>
So here lay the reason that the swamp-waters never
froze even when winter locked all other waters fast in
its icy clutch!  What caused those air bubbles, if air
bubbles they were?
</p>

<p>
At last, sick and dizzy, he turned from the place and
with raft and pole fought his way back to the shore.  Never
again, he told himself, would he try to fathom further what
lay in Lost Man's Swamp.  Weary and perspiring, he
climbed the wooded upland.  He turned and dipped into
the willows, intending to take the shortest way home
through the hardwoods.  On top of the beech knoll he
paused for a moment to let his eyes rest on the big house
in the walnut grove.  In some vague way his mind connected
its owner with that dead waste of stinking marsh.
Why, he wondered, had Hinter chosen this lonely spot
on which to build his home?  As he turned to strike across
the neck of woods between him and the causeway the man
about whom he had just been thinking stepped out from
a clump of hazel-nut bushes directly in his path.
</p>

<p>
"Why, hello, Billy," he said pleasantly.  "Out
capturing more wild things for the menagerie?"
</p>

<p>
Hinter possessed a well modulated voice whose accent
bespoke refinement and education.  He had come into the
Settlement about a year ago from no one knew where,
apparently possessed of sufficient money to do as he pleased.
An aged colored woman kept house for him.  He held aloof
from his neighbors, was reticent in manner, but nothing
could be said against him.  He led an exemplary if somewhat
secluded life, gave freely to the church which he
never attended, and was respected by the people of Scotia.
With the children he was a great favorite.  He was a tall
man, gaunt and strong of frame and well past middle age.
His face was grave and his blue eyes steady.  He was fond
of hunting and usually wore&mdash;as he was wearing today&mdash;a
suit of corduroys.  He kept a pair of ferocious dogs, why
nobody knew, for they never accompanied him on his
hunts.
</p>

<p>
He smiled now as he noted Billy's quick look of
apprehension.
</p>

<p>
"No, Billy," he assured the boy, "Sphinx and Dexter
aren't with me today, so you have nothing to fear from
them.  I doubt if they would hurt you, anyway," he added.
"You can handle most dogs, I am told."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not afraid of no dog, Mr. Hinter," said Billy,
"but I've been told your dogs are half wolf.  Is that so?"
</p>

<p>
Hinter laughed.  "Well, hardly," he returned.  "They
are thoroughbred Great Danes, although Sphinx and Dexter
both have wolf natures, I fear."
</p>

<p>
"Is that why people don't go near your place, 'cause
they're scared of the dogs?" Billy asked.
</p>

<p>
Hinter's face grew grave.  "Perhaps," he answered.
"I hope it is."
</p>

<p>
"Then why don't you get rid of 'em?"
</p>

<p>
Hinter shook his head.  "Nobody would have them,
they're too savage; and I haven't the heart to make away
with them, because they are fond of me.  I've had those
dogs a long time, Billy."
</p>

<p>
"I understan'," said Billy, sympathetically.
</p>

<p>
Hinter put his hand in his coat pocket and drew out
an ivory dog-whistle.  "Would you like to know them,
Billy?" he asked, his keen eyes on the boy's face.
</p>

<p>
"I wouldn't mind," said Billy.
</p>

<p>
Hinter put the whistle to his lips and sent a warbling
call through the woods.  "Stand perfectly still," he said,
as he placed the whistle back in his pocket.  "I won't let
them hurt you.  Here they come now."
</p>

<p>
The next instant two great dogs plunged from the thicket,
their heavy jaws open and dripping and their deep eyes
searching for their master and the reason for his call.
</p>

<p>
Standing with feet planted wide Billy felt his heart beat
quickly.  "Easy, Sphinx!" Hinter cried, as the larger
of the two sprang toward the boy.  Immediately the dog
sank down, the personification of submission; but its
bloodshot eyes flashed up at Billy and in them the boy glimpsed
a spirit unquelled.
</p>

<p>
"Be careful, Billy.  Don't touch him!" warned Hinter,
but he spoke too late.  Billy had bent and laid his hand
gently on the dog's quivering back.  The low growl died in
the animal's throat.  Slowly his heavy muzzle was lifted
until his nose touched Billy's cheek.  Then his long
flail-like tail began to wag.
</p>

<p>
"Boy, you're a wonder!" Hinter cried.  "But you
took a terrible chance.  Dexter!" he said to the other
dog, "don't you want to be friends with this wild-animal
tamer, too?"
</p>

<p>
Billy, his arm about Sphinx's neck, spoke.  "Come, ol'
feller; come here," he said.
</p>

<p>
The great dog rose and came slowly across to him.
"Good boy!"  Billy slapped him roughly on the shoulder,
and he whined.
</p>

<p>
"Well, it's beyond me," confessed Hinter.  "I've heard
that you could handle dogs, young fellow, but I didn't
think there was anybody in the world besides myself who
could bring a whimper of gladness from that pair.  Now
then, Dexter!  Sphinx! away home with you."  Obediently
the big dogs wheeled back into the thicket.
</p>

<p>
Billy started to move away.  "I must be gettin' home,"
he said.  "The cows'll be waitin' to be watered."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'll just walk along with you as far as the
Causeway," said Hinter.  "My saddle-horse has wandered
off somewhere.  I have an idea he made for Ringold's
slashing."
</p>

<p>
He fell in beside Billy, adjusting his stride to the shorter
one of the boy.  In silence they walked until they reached
a rise of land which had been cleared of all varieties of
trees except maples.  Sap-suckers twittered as they hung
head downward and red squirrels chattered shrilly.  In a
cleared spot in the wood, beside a spring-fed creek, stood
a sugar-shanty, two great cauldrons, upside down, gleaming
like black eyes from its shadowy interior.  A pile of wooden
sap-troughs stood just outside the shanty door.
</p>

<p>
Billy's eyes brightened as they swept the big sugar-bush.
Many a spicy spring night had he enjoyed here, "sugarin'
off"&mdash;he and Teacher Stanhope.  The brightness faded
from his eyes and his lip quivered.  Never again would
the man who was boy-friend to him point out the
frost-cleared stars that swam low down above the maples and
describe to him their wonders.  Those stars were shut out
from him forever, as were the tints of skies and flowers and
all glad lights of the world.
</p>

<p>
Hinter's voice brought him back to himself.  "He is
blind, they tell me, Billy."
</p>

<p>
Billy gazed at him wonderingly.  "How did you know
I was thinkin' of <i>him</i>?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
Hinter smiled.  "Never mind," he said gently.  "And
how is he standing it?"
</p>

<p>
A spasm of pain crossed the boy's face.  "Like a man,"
he answered shortly.
</p>

<p>
Hinter's eyes fell away from that steady gaze.  Billy
turned towards the log-span across the creek, then paused
to ask suddenly: "Mr. Hinter, who owns that Lost Man's
Swamp?  Do you?"
</p>

<p>
The man started.  "No," he answered, "I don't own it
exactly, but I hope to soon.  It is part of the Scroggie
property.  I am negotiating now with Scroggie's heir for
it.  It is useless, of course, but I desire to own it for
reasons known only to myself."
</p>

<p>
"But supposin' ol' Scroggie's lost will comes to light?"
</p>

<p>
"Then, of course, it will divert to Mr. Stanhope,"
answered Hinter.  "I must confess," he added, "I doubt
very strongly if Mr. Scroggie ever made a will."
</p>

<p>
Billy was silent, busy with his own thoughts.  They
crossed the bridge, passed through a beech ridge and
descended a mossy slope to the Causeway fence.  As they sat
for a moment's rest on its topmost rail, Hinter spoke
abruptly.  "I saw you fighting your way across the swamp
this afternoon, Billy.  Weren't you taking a useless risk?"
</p>

<p>
Billy made no reply.
</p>

<p>
"You are either a very brave boy or a very foolish
one," said Hinter.  "Will you tell me what prompted
you to dare what no other person in the Settlement would
dare!  Was it simply curiosity?"
</p>

<p>
"I guess maybe it was," Billy confessed.  "Anyways
I've got all I want of it.  It'll be a long time afore you
see me there ag'in."
</p>

<p>
Hinter's sigh of relief was inaudible to the boy.  "That's
a good resolve," he commended.  "Stick to it; that swamp
is a treacherous place."
</p>

<p>
"It's awful," said Billy in awed tones.  "I got as far
as the first pond.  It was far enough for me."
</p>

<p>
"You got as far as the pond!" Hinter cried in wonder.
The eyes turned on Billy's face were searching.  "And
you found only a long shallow of stagnant, stinking water,
I'll be bound," he laughed, uneasily.
</p>

<p>
"I found&mdash;" Billy commenced, his mind flashing back
to the bubbling geysers of the pond&mdash;then chancing to
catch the expression in Hinter's face he finished, "jest
what you said, a big pond of stinkin' dead water, crawlin'
with all kinds of blood-suckers an' things."
</p>

<p>
He leaped from the fence.  "Good bye," he called back
over his shoulder.  "I hear old Cherry bawlin' fer her
drink."
</p>

<p>
Hinter was still seated on the fence when Billy turned
the curve in the road.  "I wonder what he wants of Lost
Man's Swamp," mused the boy.  "An' I wonder what
he's scared somebody'll find there?"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XI
<br /><br />
EDUCATING THE NEW BOY
</h3>

<p>
As Billy rounded a curve in the road he met the cattle.
Anson was driving them.  "You needn't mind turnin' back,
Bill," he said.  "I don't mind waterin' 'em fer you."
</p>

<p>
Billy whistled.  "Gosh! you're gettin' kind all at once,
Anse," he exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"I don't mind doin' it," Anse repeated.  He kept his
face averted.  Billy, scenting mystery, walked over to him
and swung him about.  Anson's lip was swollen and one
eye was partly closed and his freckled face bore the marks
of recent conflict.
</p>

<p>
"Gee whitticker!" gasped Billy, "you must been havin'
an argument with a mule.  Who give you that black eye
an' split lip, Anse?"
</p>

<p>
His brother hung his head.  "You needn't go to rubbin'
it in," he whined; "I didn't have no chance with him.  He
piled on me from behind, when I wasn't lookin'."
</p>

<p>
"Who piled on you from behind?"
</p>

<p>
"That new boy; his name's Jim Scroggie.  His dad's
rented the Stanley house on the hill."
</p>

<p>
"Likely story that about his pilin' on you from behind,"
scoffed Billy.  "You met him on the path an' tried to get
gay with him, more like, an' he pasted you a few.  You
shouldn't hunt trouble, Anse; you can't fight, an' you know
it.  What's this new boy like?" he asked curiously.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you'll find that out soon enough," promised Anson.
"He told me to tell you that he would do the same thing
to you first chance he got."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, he didn't neither," laughed Billy.  "He can't
be that foolish."
</p>

<p>
"You wait till you size him up," said Anson.  "He's
taller'n you are an' heavier, too.  Oh, you'll have your
hands full when he tackles you, Mister Scrapper-Bill."
</p>

<p>
Billy pinched off a fox-tail stock and chewed it
thoughtfully.  "Maybe," he said, cheerfully.  "He certainly
tapped you some, but then you're always huntin' trouble,
an' it serves you right."
</p>

<p>
"Listen to me!" Anson cried.  "He made all the trouble,
I tell you.  All I did was tell him not to throw clubs
at Ringdo&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What!  Was he throwin' clubs at my coon?" Billy
shouted.
</p>

<p>
"You bet he was.  Had Ringdo up a tree an' was doin'
his best to knock him out."
</p>

<p>
Billy spit out the fox-tail.  "Where's this feller Scroggie
now?" he asked, in a business-like tone.
</p>

<p>
"I dunno.  I s'pose he's prowlin' 'round the beech
grove, up there.  He said he intended lickin' every boy in
this settlement on sight.  You best not go lookin' fer him,
Bill.  I don't want'a see you get beat up on my account."
</p>

<p>
"Well you needn't worry; if I get beat up it won't be
on your account, I kin tell you that.  I don't aim to let
anybody throw clubs at my pets, though.  You drive the cattle
on down; I'm goin' up to the grove."
</p>

<p>
A gleam of satisfaction lit Anson's shifty eyes.  "All
right," he said shortly, and went off after the herd.
</p>

<p>
Billy climbed the rail fence and crossed the basswood
swale to the highland.  He approached the beech grove
cautiously and peered about him.  Seated on a log at the
lower end of a grassy glade was a boy about his own age,
a boy with round, bullet head poised on a thick neck set
between square shoulders.
</p>

<p>
Billy, taking his measure with one fleeting glance, stepped
out from the trees.  Simultaneously the strange boy rose
slowly, head lowered, fists clenched.  There was nothing
antagonistic in Billy's attitude as he surveyed the new boy
with serious grey eyes.  That expression had fooled more
than one competitor in fistic combat, and it fooled Jim
Scroggie now.  "He's scared stiff," was the new boy's
thought, as he swaggered forward to where Billy stood.
</p>

<p>
"I've been waitin' for you and now I'm goin' to lick
you," he said.
</p>

<p>
Billy eyed him appraisingly.  He did look like a tough
proposition, no doubt about that.  His face was round,
flat, small-featured.  "That face'll stand a lot of
pummelin'," Billy told himself, and as he noted the heavy chin,
thrust antagonistically forward, "no use bruisin' my
knuckles on that," he decided.
</p>

<p>
"You heard what I said, didn't you?" growled the
challenger.  "I'm goin' to lick you."
</p>

<p>
Billy grinned.  He had caught the gasp at the end of the
speaker's words; <i>now</i> he knew where lay the stranger's
weak spot&mdash;<i>his wind</i>!
</p>

<p>
"But I ain't wantin' to fight," Billy returned gently.
</p>

<p>
"Why? scared?"
</p>

<p>
"Nice boys don't fight."  Billy shifted his feet uneasily,
the movement bringing him a step or two closer to the other.
</p>

<p>
"Bah! mommie's baby boy won't fight?" taunted the
eager one.  "But by gollies!  I'm goin' to make you," he
added, scowling fiercely.
</p>

<p>
Billy wanted to laugh, but he was too good a ring-general
to give way to his feelings.  Instead, he shifted his feet
again, thereby getting within reaching distance of the one
so anxious for battle.
</p>

<p>
"Now, then," declared Scroggie, tossing his hat on the
sward and drying his moist palms on his trouser-legs, "I'm
goin' to black your eyes and pummel the nose off your
face."
</p>

<p>
The last word was drowned in a resounding "smack."  Billy
had delivered one of his lightning, straight-arm
punches fair on the sneering lips of the new boy.  Scroggie
staggered back, recovered his balance, and threw himself on
the defensive in time to block Billy's well-aimed right to
the neck.
</p>

<p>
"So that's your game, is it?" he grunted.  "Here's a
new one for you then."  That "new one" was a veritable
"hay-maker."  Had it landed where it was intended to land
the fight must have ended then and there.  But it didn't.
Billy saw it coming and ducked.
</p>

<p>
Scroggie rushed, managing to get in a stiff jab to Billy's
body and receiving in return one which promptly closed
one of his small optics.  He struck out wildly, but Billy was
prancing six feet away.  Scroggie's swollen and bleeding
mouth twisted in a grin.  "Oh, I'll get you," he promised.
"Stall if you want'a, it's all one to me.  You won't find
me sleepin' again, I promise you."
</p>

<p>
Billy advanced in a crouching attitude.  His eyes were on
Scroggie's uninjured eye and Scroggie, now grown wary,
read that look as Billy intended he should.  Older fighters
have made the same mistake that Scroggie made.  As Billy
leaped in Scroggie raised his guard to his face and Billy's
right and left thudded home to the flabby stomach of his
adversary.
</p>

<p>
With a gasp Scroggie went to earth, where he lay writhing.
After a time he struggled to a sitting posture.
</p>

<p>
"Got enough?" asked Billy pleasantly.
</p>

<p>
The vanquished one nodded.  He had not as yet recovered
his breath sufficiently to speak.  When at last he was able
to draw a full breath, he said: "Say, you trimmed me all
right, all right."
</p>

<p>
Billy grinned.
</p>

<p>
"Who are you, anyway?" asked Scroggie as he got
groggily to his feet.
</p>

<p>
"I'm the feller that owns the coon you tried to club to
death," Billy answered.
</p>

<p>
Scroggie's mouth fell open in surprise.  "I didn't try to
kill any coon," he denied.  "I saw one but it wasn't me
that clubbed it; it was a tall, sandy-haired feller with a
squint eye.  I asked him what he was tryin' to do and he
told me to dry up and mind my own business.  I had to
give him a lickin'.  He went off blubberin'; said if I wasn't
too scared to stick around he'd send a feller over who would
fix me.  So I stayed."
</p>

<p>
"I wish you had licked him harder 'n you did," frowned
Billy.
</p>

<p>
"Know him?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I do&mdash;an' I don't.  He's my half-brother an' a
sneak if ever there was one.  He lied about you to
me&mdash;so's I'd fight you."
</p>

<p>
"And what's your name?"
</p>

<p>
"Billy Wilson."
</p>

<p>
Scroggie stared.  "I've heard of you," he said, "an'
the feller who told me you could lick your weight in
wildcats wasn't far wrong.  You had me fooled, though," he
laughed.  "I swallowed what you said about nice boys not
fightin', swallowed it whole.  Oh, Moses!"
</p>

<p>
Billy sat down on a stump.  "I don't bear no grudge,
do you?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"No, I'm willin' to shake."  Scroggie extended his hand.
</p>

<p>
"Your name's Scroggie, ain't it?" Billy asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yep, Jim Scroggie."
</p>

<p>
"Your Dad's goin' to cut down the Scroggie woods,
I hear?"
</p>

<p>
"Yep, if he can get his price for the timber."
</p>

<p>
Billy sat looking away.  His grey eyes had grown somber.
"See here," he said suddenly, "do you know that old man
Scroggie left a will?"
</p>

<p>
"Dad says not," the other boy replied.
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, he did; an' in that will he left his woods
an' money to Mr. Stanhope, my teacher."
</p>

<p>
"If that's so, Dad has no right to that woods," said Jim.
</p>

<p>
"But supposin' the will can't be found?"  Billy looked
the other boy in the face and waited for the answer.
</p>

<p>
"Why, I can't see that that ought'a make any difference,"
Scroggie replied.  "If you folks down here know
that Uncle left his money and place to your teacher, that
ought'a be enough for Dad."
</p>

<p>
"Of course the timber's worth a lot," sparred Billy.
</p>

<p>
"But Dad don't need it," Jim declared.  "He's rich
now."
</p>

<p>
"He is?"  Billy respected the new boy for the nonchalance
of his tones.  Riches hadn't made him stuck up, at
any rate.
</p>

<p>
"Yep," went on Scroggie, "Dad owns some big oil
wells in the States.  He ain't got any business down here
anyways, but he's so pig-headed you can't tell him anythin';
I'll say that much, even if he is my father.  It's bad
enough for him to lug me away from town, but he made
Lou come along, too."
</p>

<p>
"Lou?"
</p>

<p>
"She's my sister," Jim explained proudly.  "She's a
year younger'n me.  Dad says she looks just like Mother
looked.  I guess that's the reason she kin do most anythin'
she likes with him.  But she couldn't get him to let her
stay in Cleveland.  He brought her along and Aunt too.
Aunt keeps house for us."
</p>

<p>
"I guess your Dad don't think much of us folks down
here, does he?" Billy asked.
</p>

<p>
Scroggie chuckled.  "Dad ain't got any use for anybody,
much," he answered.  "I never heard him say anythin'
about any of the people of the Settlement but once,
and that was just t'other night.  He come home lookin' as
if somebody had pushed his head into a crate of eggs.  I
was too scared to ask him how it happened and Lou
wouldn't.  Dad said the people 'round here are a bad
lot and it wouldn't surprise him if they tried to kill him."
</p>

<p>
Billy threw back his head and laughed, the first hearty
laugh he had known for days.  Scroggie, in spite of the
pain his swollen lips caused him, laughed too.
</p>

<p>
"Say," he remarked, hesitatingly, "you got a great
laugh, Billy."
</p>

<p>
"Oh I don't know," Billy replied.  "What makes you
think so, Jim?"  Scroggie sat down beside him on the log.
"I had a chum in the city who laughed just like you do.
Gosh, nobody'll know how much I miss him."
</p>

<p>
"Dead?"
</p>

<p>
Scroggie nodded.  "Drowned through an air-hole in the
lake.  Say, Billy, do you skate?"
</p>

<p>
"Some."
</p>

<p>
"Swim?"
</p>

<p>
"A little."
</p>

<p>
"Shoot?"
</p>

<p>
Billy scratched his head reflectively.  "Not much, any
more," he said.  "Course I like duck-shootin', an' do quite
a lot of it in the fall."
</p>

<p>
"How 'bout quail?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't shoot quail any more," Billy answered.  "I've
got to know 'em too well, I guess.  You see," in answer to
the other boy's look of surprise, "when a feller gets to
know what chummy, friendly little beggars they are, he
don't feel like shootin' 'em."
</p>

<p>
"But they're wild, ain't they and they're game birds?"
</p>

<p>
"They're wild if you make 'em wild, but if they get to
know that you like 'em an' won't hurt 'em, they get real
tame.  I've got one flock I call my own.  I fed 'em last
winter when the snow was so deep they couldn't pick up a
livin'.  They used to come right into our barn-yard for the
tailin's I throwed out to 'em."
</p>

<p>
"What's tailin's?"
</p>

<p>
"It's the chaff and small wheat the fannin' mill blows
out from the good grain.  Pa lets me have it fer my wild
birds.  I've got some partridge up on the hickory knoll,
too.  They're shyer than the quail, but I've got 'em so tame
I kin call 'em and make 'em come to me."
</p>

<p>
"You kin?" Jim exclaimed.  "Well, I'll be razzle-dazzled!"
</p>

<p>
"So, I don't shoot partridge neither," said Billy.  "I
don't blame anybody else fer shootin' 'em, remember, but
somehow, I'd rather leave 'em alive."
</p>

<p>
"I see," said Scroggie.  Of course he didn't, but he
wanted to make Billy feel that he did.
</p>

<p>
"Well you do more than most people, then," said Billy.
"The folks 'round here think I'm crazy, I guess, an' Joe
Scraff&mdash;he's got an English setter dog an' shoots a lot; he
told me that if he happened onto my quail an' partridge
he'd bag as many of 'em as he could.  I told him that if he
shot my birds, he'd better watch out fer his white Leghorn
chickens but he laughed at me."
</p>

<p>
"And did he shoot your quail?" asked Scroggie.
</p>

<p>
Billy nodded.  "Once.  Flushed 'em at the top of the
knoll and winged one bird.  The rest of the covey flew into
our barn-yard an' 'course he couldn't foller 'em in there."
</p>

<p>
"Gillies!  Did you see him?"
</p>

<p>
"No, me an' Pa an' Anse was down at the back end of
the place.  Ma saw him, though, an' she told me all about
it.  Say, maybe I wasn't mad, but I got even, all right."
</p>

<p>
"Did you?  How?"
</p>

<p>
Billy looked searchingly at his new friend.  "I never
told a soul how I did it, 'cept my chum, Maurice Keeler,"
he said.  "But I'll tell you.  That same evenin' I was
prowlin' through the slashin' lookin' fer white grubs fer
bass-bait.  I found a big rotten stump, so I pushed it over,
an' right down under the roots I found an old weasel an' six
half-grown kittens.  Afore she could get over her surprise, I
had her an' her family in the tin pail I had with me, an' the
cover on.  By rights I should'a killed the whole caboodle
of 'em, I s'pose, 'cause they're mighty hard on the birds;
but I had work fer 'em to do.
</p>

<p>
"That night I took them weasels over to Scraff's an'
turned 'em loose under his barn.  I knowed mighty well
ma weasel would stay where it was dark an' safe and the
chicken smell was so strong.  Couple of days after that
Scraff come over to our place to borrow some rat traps.
His face was so long he was fair steppin' on his lower lip.
He said weasels had been slaughterin' his Leghorns, right
an' left; six first night an' nine the next.
</p>

<p>
"'I hope they won't get among my quail,' I says, an'
Scraff he turned round an' looked at me mighty hard, but
he didn't say nuthin'.  He went away, grumblin', an'
carryin' six of Dad's traps.  Course I knowed he couldn't
catch a weasel in a trap in twenty years an' he didn't catch
any either.  Ma weasel killed some more of his Leghorns,
an' then Scraff he comes to me.  'Billy,' he says, 'is there
any way to get rid of weasels?'  'Sure there's a way,' I
says, 'but not everybody knows it.'
</p>

<p>
"'I'll give you five dollars if you'll catch them weasels
that are killin' my chickens,' he says.
</p>

<p>
"'If you'll promise me you'll stay away from my quail
an' partridge I'll catch 'em fer nuthin,' I told him.  'Only,'
I says, 'remember, I do what I please with 'em, after I get
'em.'  He looked at me as though he'd like to choke me,
but he said all right, he'd leave my birds alone.
</p>

<p>
"That night Maurice Keeler an' me went over to Gamble's
an' borrowed his old ferret.  He's a big ferret an'
he'll tackle anythin', even a skunk.  With some keg-hoops
an' a canvas sack we had made what we needed to catch
the weasels in.  Then we put a muzzle on the ferret, so he
couldn't fang-cut the weasels, an' we went over to Scraff's.
As soon as Joe Scraff saw the ferret he began to see light
an' turned into the house to get his shotgun.  I told him
to remember his promise to let me get the weasels alive, so
he set on the fence an' watched while we got busy.
</p>

<p>
"First off we plugged every hole under that barn but
two, an' at each of these two we set a hoop-net.  Then we
turned ol' Lucifer, the ferret, loose under the barn.  Holy
Smoke! afore we knowed it there was high jinks goin' on
tinder there.  Maurice had hold of one hoop an' me the
other.  It took ma weasel an' her boys an' girls 'bout half
a minute to make up their minds that ol' Lucifer wasn't
payin' 'em a friendly visit.  When the big scramble was
over, I had a bagful of weasels an' so did Maurice.  We let
Lucifer prowl round a little longer to make sure we had
all of 'em, then I called him out.  I made Scraff give us
one of his hens to feed the ferret on.  Then Maurice an' me
started off.
</p>

<p>
"'You think you got all of 'em, Bill?" Scraff called.
</p>

<p>
"'All this time,' I says, an' to save my life I couldn't
help laughin' at the look on his face.  He knowed right
then that I had put up a job on him but he couldn't figure
out how."
</p>

<p>
"Oh Hully Gee!" yelled Jim Scroggie, "Wasn't that
corkin'&mdash;Oh Mommer!  An' what did you an' Maurice
do with the weasels?"
</p>

<p>
Billy grinned sheepishly.  "We should'a killed 'em, I
s'pose," he said, "but we took 'em down to the marsh an'
turned 'em loose there.  Maurice said that anythin' that
had done the good work them weasels had, deserved life, an'
I thought so too."
</p>

<p>
The twilight shadows were beginning to steal across the
glade; the golden-rod of the uplands massed into
indistinguishable clumps.  The silence of eventide fell soft and
sweet and songless&mdash;that breathless space between the
forest day and darkness.
</p>

<p>
Billy stood up.  "You'll like it here," he said to the
other boy who was watching him, a strange wonder in his
eyes.  "After you know it better," he added.
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid I don't fit very well yet," Scroggie
answered.  "Maybe you'll let me trail along with you
sometimes, Bill, and learn things?"
</p>

<p>
"We'll see," said Billy and without another word turned
to the dim pathway among the trees.

<h3>
CHAPTER XII
</h3>

<h3>
OLD HARRY MAKES A FIND
</h3>

<p>
Through the dusky twilight, soft with woodland dews
and sweet with odor of ferns and wild flowers, Billy walked
slowly.  For the first time in long days his heart felt at
peace.  The canker of loneliness that had gnawed at his
spirit was there no longer.  It was a pretty good old world
after all.
</p>

<p>
A whip-poor-will lilted its low call from a hazel copse
and Billy answered it.  A feeling that he wanted to visit
his wild things in the upland shanty and explain to them
his seeming neglect of them during his time of stress took
possession of him.  So, although he knew supper would be
ready and waiting at home, he branched off where the
path forked and hurried forward toward the oak ridge.
</p>

<p>
It was almost dark when he reached the little log
sugar-shanty which housed his pets.  He had hidden a lantern
in a hollow log against such night visits as this and he
paused to draw it out and light it before proceeding to
the menagerie.  As he rounded the shanty, whistling softly,
and anticipating how glad Spotba, Moper, the owl, and all
the other wild inmates would be to see him, he paused
suddenly, and the whistle died on his lips.  Somebody had
been snooping about his menagerie!  The prop had been
taken from the door.
</p>

<p>
His mind traveled at once to Anse.  So that meddler
had been here and tried to let his pets free, had he?
Apparently the chump didn't know they each had a separate
cage, or if he did he hadn't the nerve to open it.  Well,
it meant that Anse had that much more to settle for with
him, that was all!
</p>

<p>
Billy put his hand on the latch of the door, then stood,
frozen into inaction.  From the interior of the shanty had
come a groan&mdash;a human groan!  Billy almost dropped the
lantern.  A cold shiver ran down his spine.  His mind
flashed to Old Scroggie's ghost.  The hand that groped into
his pocket in search of the rabbit-foot charm trembled so
it could scarcely clasp that cherished object.
</p>

<p>
What would Trigger Finger do if placed in his position?
Billy asked himself.  There was only one answer to that.
He took a long breath and, picking up a heavy club, swung
the door open.  The feeble rays of the lantern probed the
gloom and something animate, between the cages, stirred
and sat up.
</p>

<p>
"Harry!" gasped Billy, "Harry O'Dule!"
</p>

<p>
"Ha," cried a quavering voice, "and is ut the Prince
av Darkness, himself, as spakes t' me?  Thin it's no fit av
the delirium tremens I've had at all, at all, but dead I am
and in purgatory!  Oh weary me, oh weary me!  Such
shnakes and evil eyed burruds have I never seen before.
Och!  could I be given wan taste av God's blissid air and
sunshine ag'in, and never more would whiskey pass me
lips."
</p>

<p>
Spotba, the big mottled marsh snake, sensing Billy's
presence, uncoiled himself and raised his head along the
screen of his cage; the brown owl hooted a low welcome
that died in a hiss as Harry groaned again.
</p>

<p>
"Merciful hivin! look at the eyes av that awful burrud,"
he wailed.  "And that big shnake hissin' his poison in me
very face.  Take me along, Divil, take me along," he
screamed.  "It's no more av this I kin stand at all, at all."
</p>

<p>
Billy hung the lantern on the door and bent above the
grovelling Harry.  "Hey you," he said, giving the old
man's shoulder a shake, "get up an' come out'a here;
I'm not the devil, I'm Billy."
</p>

<p>
"Billy," Harry held his breath and blinked his
red-rimmed eyes in unbelief.  "Billy, ye say?"  He got up
with Billy's help and stood swaying unsteadily.
</p>

<p>
"You're drunk again!" said the boy, in deep disgust.
</p>

<p>
Harry wiped his lips on his sleeve and stood gazing
fearfully about him.  "Do you see the shnakes and the
evil-eyed burruds, Billy Bye?" he shuddered.  "It's see 'em
ye shurely can and hear their divil hisses."  His fingers
gripped the boy's arm.
</p>

<p>
Billy shook him off.  "Look here, Harry," he said,
"You're seein' things.  There ain't no snakes in here&mdash;no
birds neither.  You come along outside with me."  He
grasped the Irishman by the arm and started toward the
door.
</p>

<p>
"Me jug," whispered Harry.  "Where is that divil's
halter av a jug, Billy?"
</p>

<p>
"There's your jug on its side," Billy touched the jug
with his foot.  "You must've drunk it empty, Harry."
</p>

<p>
"Faith, an' I did not.  But ut's all the same, impty or
full.  Niver ag'in will ut lead me into delirium tremens, I
promise ye that, although it's meself that knows where
there's a plinty of whisky, so I do."
</p>

<p>
Billy led him outside and turned the light of the lantern
full on his face.  "Harry," he said, sternly, "where
are you gettin' all this whisky?"
</p>

<p>
The old man started.  "That's me own business," he
answered shortly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh."  Billy took hold of his arm, "Then them snakes
an' man-eatin' birds you've been seein' are your own business,
too; an' since you've been ninny enough to stray into
this shanty, I'm goin' to put you back in it an' see that
you stay in it."
</p>

<p>
"And fer God's sake, why?" gasped the frightened O'Dule.
</p>

<p>
"That's my business," said Billy.
</p>

<p>
Harry glanced behind him with a shudder.  "God love
you fer a good lad, Billy," he cried; "but this is no way to
trate an ould frind, is ut now?"
</p>

<p>
"Then you best tell me where you're gettin' the whisky,"
said Billy.
</p>

<p>
"But that's shure the ould man's secret, Billy," pleaded
Harry.  "It's not a foine chap as ye are would be wheedlin'
it out av me, now?"
</p>

<p>
Billy frowned.  "I know that Spencer won't give you
any more whisky," he said, "an' I know the deacon won't
give you any more cider.  I know that you've gettin' liquor
some place&mdash;an' without payin' fer it.  Now you kin tell
me where, er you kin stay in that shanty an' see snakes an'
things all night."
</p>

<p>
Harry wavered.  "And if I be tellin' ye," he
compromised, "ye'll be givin' a promise not to pass it along,
thin?  Wull ye now?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes I promise not to tell anybody but Maurice?"
</p>

<p>
"Then I'll be tellin' ye where I do be gettin' the whisky,
Billy; <i>where else but in the ha'nted house</i>."
</p>

<p>
"What?"  Billy could scarcely believe his ears.
</p>

<p>
"May I niver glimpse the blissid blue av Ireland's skies
ag'in, if I spake a lie," said Harry, earnestly.  "In the
ha'nted house I found ut, Billy.  Wait now, and I tell ye
how ut so happened.  Ye'll be rememberin' that night we
tried to wait fer ould Scroggie's ghost an' the terrible
storm come on and split us asunder wid a flash av blue
lightnin'?  I was crossin' meself in thankfulness that ut
found the big elm instead av me, I was, whin I dropped me
fairy charm, d'ye moind?  Stay and seek fer ut I would
not, wid all the powers av darkness conspirin' wid ould
Scroggie ag'in me.  Ut's fly I did on the wings av terror
to me own cabin, an' covered up me head wid the
bed-quilt, I did."
</p>

<p>
"Well, go on.  What's all this got to do with whisky?"
</p>

<p>
"Jest you wait a bit and you'll find that out.  Nixt day
I go down there ag'in to look fer me charm, but find ut
I did not.  Then wid me little jug in me hand and me
whistle in me bosom, did I strike across woods to the
Twin Oaks store, there to learn av the robbery.  A little
bit av drink did I get from Spencer, an' takin' ut home
was I when an accident I had, an' spilled ut.  Well, ut
was afther several days av hard toil, wid not so much as
a drop left in me little jug, that one mornin' as I was
cuttin' through the lower valley fer Thompson's tater-patch,
that come to me ut did I'd search a bit fer me lost
charm ag'in.
</p>

<p>
"Ut was while pokin' about I was among the twigs on
the ground, whisperin' a bit av witch-talk that belongs to
me charm, that I discovered human foot-prints in the earth
av the hollow.  This I would not have thought strange
a'tall a'tall, but the foot prints led right into the ha'nted
grove.  'Begobs,' thinks I, 'no ghost iver wore boots the
size av them now!'  On me hands and knees I crawled
forrard an' right in the edge av the grove I glimpsed
somethin', I did, beneath the ferns, somethin' that sparkled
in the mornin' light like a bit av star-dust on the edge av
a cloud.  Thinkin' only av me blessid charm, I crawled
further in, and phwat do you suppose I picked up, Billy
Bye?  A bottle ut was, an' almost full av prime liquor.
</p>

<p>
"Sit I there, wid God's sunlight caressin' me bare head
and his burruds trillin' their joy at me good luck&mdash;and
dhrink I did.  It's a mercy ut was but a small bottle, else
I might have taken it back to me cabin to be finished at
leisure.  Instead, whin ut was all dhrunk up, I found
widin me the courage to proceed further into the ha'nted
grove.  So I goes, an' afore I knew ut, right up to the
ha'nted house I was, and inside ut."
</p>

<p>
Harry paused and sat looking away, a reminiscent smile
on his face.
</p>

<p>
"What did you find there?"  Billy's tone of impatience
brought the old man out of his musing.
</p>

<p>
"Whisky," he answered solemnly, "two great jugs full
avut, Billy Bye."
</p>

<p>
"And what else?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothin' else," returned Harry.  "Nuthin' else that
mattered, Bye.  A square box there was that I had no time
to open a'tall; but whisky!  Oh, Billy Bye&mdash;there ut was
afore me, enough av ut to coax all the blood-suckin' bats
and snakes in hades up to mock the consumer av ut."
</p>

<p>
Billy reached down and gripped the old man's arm.
"You found that stuff and didn't so much as tell
Spencer?" he cried indignantly.
</p>

<p>
"And fer why should I tell Spencer, thin?" Harry
asked, his blood-shot eyes wide in wonder.  "Nobuddy
told me where to find ut, did they?"
</p>

<p>
"But Harry, don't you see, that stuff belongs to Caleb
Spencer.  The thieves must have hid it there, in the ha'nted
house."
</p>

<p>
"Course they did," Harry agreed.  "Ut's no fool you
take me fer, shurely?"
</p>

<p>
"Then why didn't you tell Spencer?  Don't you know
them thieves will find out you've been there an' they'll hide
that stuff in a new place, Harry?"
</p>

<p>
The old man laughed softly.  "Wull they now?  Well
I guess they won't neither.  It's hide ut in a new place I
did, meself.  They'll have a lot av trouble afindin' ut,
too."
</p>

<p>
"Then," cried Billy, hotly, "you're as big a thief as
they are."
</p>

<p>
"Hould on now!"  Harry swayed up from the log, the
grin gone from his face.  "Ut's little did I think that Billy
Wilson would be misunderstandin' me," he said, reproachfully.
"Not wan article that the box contained has been
teched by me.  A small bit av the whisky have I took,
because it was no more than sufficient reward fer me findin'
the stuff, but the box is safe and safe ut wull be returned
to Spencer whin the proper time comes."
</p>

<p>
"An' when'll that be, Harry?"
</p>

<p>
"Listen thin."  Harry touched Billy's arm.  "Ivery
day since I made me discovery an' hid box and jugs in a
new spot have I visited that sour-faced ould Spencer, and
I've said: 'Supposin' one should discover your stolen
goods, Caleb Spencer, would ye be willin' t' let what little
whisky there was left go to the finder?"
</p>

<p>
"An' phwat has he said?  'Some av ut,' said he, when
first I broached the question.  And the nixt time I axed
him he said.  'Half av ut.'  Nixt time&mdash;only yesterday ut
was&mdash;he said, 'Harry, I'd be givin' two-thirds av ut to
the finder.'"
</p>

<p>
Harry laughed and again touched Billy's arm.  "To-night
ut's go back to him I wull an' the question put to
him once more, an' this night, plase God, he wull likely
say, 'All av ut, Harry, all av ut.'"
</p>

<p>
Billy, who was thinking hard, looked up at this.  "But,"
he said sternly, "you said, only a few minutes ago, that
you were done forever with whisky."
</p>

<p>
"And begobs I meant ut too," cried Harry.  "When
Caleb Spencer says, 'All av ut' to me, ut's laugh at him
I wull, and tell him it's meself wants none av ut."
</p>

<p>
Billy's frown vanished.  "Fine, Harry, fine," he
commended, "an' I'll go down to the store with you.  Come
up to the house, now, and I'll manage to sneak you out
some supper."
</p>

<p>
"Plase God," murmured Harry, "but ut's meself 'll
be glad to lave this awful spot; lead on, Billy."
</p>

<p>
"Foller me then, an' remember to keep quiet,"
cautioned Billy.
</p>

<p>
"But fer why should I keep quiet?  Haven't I thrown
off the curse av rum!  Why should I not shout the cry av
victory, Billy?
</p>

<p>
"Shout nuthin'; you keep still."
</p>

<p>
"But a small bit av a chune, Billy.  A bit av a lilt on
me whistle, now."
</p>

<p>
"No.  After I've got hold of our supper you kin lilt
all you care to.  Look here, Harry, you know jest how
much use Ma has fer you; if she finds out you're on our
place, she'll sick the dog on you.  Now you do as I say."
</p>

<p>
He took the path through the trees, Harry stumbling
close behind, grumbling and protesting against the unkind
fate that would not allow of his celebrating victory in a
manner befitting a true son of Ireland.  When, at length,
they reached the edge of the wood, Billy stopped and
pointed to a stump.
</p>

<p>
"Set down there an' keep still as a mouse till I get
back," he admonished.  "I won't be long."
</p>

<p>
"But, Billy Bye, supposin' the cold-eyed burruds an'
the hissin' serpents should be returnin' to threaten me
wance ag'in?"
</p>

<p>
Billy's hand went down into his trouser's pocket.
"Look," he comforted, "I've got my rabbit-foot charm,
an' I'm goin' to draw a magic circle 'round the stump
you're settin' on.  No snakes, owl, ner even old Scroggie's
ghost kin get inside that circle."
</p>

<p>
Harry held his breath and watched him, fascinated, as
he proceeded to trace the ring.
</p>

<p>
"Fer the love av hivin, be sure ye make both inds av the
circle jine," he shivered.  "Ut's a small crack a ghost kin
squeeze through, I'm tellin' ye."
</p>

<p>
"There you are, Harry."  Billy, having completed the
magic circle, stood up and put the charm back in his
pocket.  "Not a chink in it," he assured the old man.
</p>

<p>
"Faith," sighed Harry, "ut's meself is willin' to be
riskin' a little in return fer a bite to eat, fer it's fastin'
long I've been an' as impty as a church, I am."
</p>

<p>
"We'll fix that," Billy promised, as he slipped away
through the darkness toward the light which glimmered
through the trees.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII
<br /><br />
ERIE OF THE LIGHT-HOUSE
</h3>

<p>
Through the summer night, Hinter, astride a rangy roan,
rode the ten mile trail that lay between the foot of Rond
Eau and the light-house.  On his left the giant pines stood
with sharp points clearly defined against the starlight like
the bayonet-fixed guns of a sleeping army; to his right
swept dwarf cedars and stunted oaks and beyond them
the bay marshes, with weaving fire-flies shimmering like
star-dust close above them.
</p>

<p>
It was a lonely trail but Hinter had ridden it often.
He knew that in the shadows lurked wild things which
resented his intrusion of their retreat; that later, when
the night grew old, timber-wolves would voice their protest,
and fierce-eyed lynx, tufted ears flat and fangs bared
in hatred, would look down upon him from overhanging
branch of tree.  But behind him stalked protection in the
form of two great dogs against which no wolf or cat had
ever waged successful warfare.  Besides, there was the
heavy "40-40" revolver in his belt.
</p>

<p>
"Two Great Danes and a 'bull-dog' should be protection
enough for any man," he would laugh to Landon, the
light-house keeper, when the latter shook his head doubtfully
over Hinter's foolhardiness in riding this lone night
trail.  And Landon, whose asthma made talking difficult
for him, would say no more, realizing that it was useless.
</p>

<p>
The light-house keeper, who lived with his daughter in
a comfortable house on the extreme end of the Point, had
always been glad to welcome Hinter to his isolated
loneliness.  With an invalid's self-centeredness, he believed that
it was to relieve the monotony of his existence that this
man paid him periodical visits.  He did not dream that
his daughter, Erie, named after the lake, whose blue lay
deep in her eyes and whose moods were of herself a part,
was the real attraction which drew Hinter to their home.
Indeed it would have taken a much more astute observer
than the man who had been keeper of the light for more
than thirty years to have observed this.  Never by look,
word or sign had Hinter shown that in this slender,
golden-haired girl, whose laughter was the sweetest note in the
world&mdash;this girl who could trim a sail in biting gale and
swim the wide, deep channel when tempest angered it to
clutching under-currents&mdash;was more to him than just a
glad, natural product of her world.  Always his manner
towards her had been one of kindly respect.  In time she
grew ashamed of the distrust she had on first acquaintance
intuitively felt for him.  He was good to her father and
considerate of her.  He talked interestingly of the big
outside world and described the cities he had visited.  Her
father liked him and always looked forward to his visits,
and with a sick man's petulance grumbled if Hinter failed
to come on his regular nights.
</p>

<p>
"He's a fine man, Erie," he would say to is daughter,
"and well off, too.  I'd like to see you married to a man
like Hinter before I go.  Ever since your Ma died, I've
been worried about leavin' you behind."
</p>

<p>
"But I am going to marry Frank, Daddy," the girl
would say softly.
</p>

<p>
"Hey?  Oh, all right, all right.  Stanhope's a fine
youngster, but poor, poor."
</p>

<p>
He would lapse into silence, sucking his pipe, and watching
Erie putting away the supper-dishes.
</p>

<p>
"He'll never find the Scroggie will," he would speak
again.  "He'll always be poor."
</p>

<p>
"But, Daddy," the girl would laugh, "we love each
other.  We are happy and real happiness is worth more
than money, isn't it, dear?"
</p>

<p>
"Aye," he would answer.  "Your mother and I were
happy in that way.  But she was taken away and all I
had in her place was heart loneliness&mdash;but for you."  Then
she would kiss him softly and, stealing about her household
tasks, sing him to fitful sleep as she moved quietly
about the room.
</p>

<p>
Tonight as Hinter rode through the pine-scented gloom
the light-house keeper sat in his big chair beside the window
that looked upon the lake.  Spent from a trying fit of
coughing, his nerves crying for the rest which was denied
him, the sick man had gazed across to where the shuttle
of sunset was weaving its fabric of changing colors upon
sky and water.  But he had not seen those glad lights;
had not heard the cries of the haven-seeking gulls or the
soft plaintive notes of the night birds from the Point
forest.  The lights had flashed and departed unseen, the
wild calls had been voiced and sunk to silence unheard,
because a tenderer light, which had belonged to this, his
own hour, had vanished; a sweeter song than even night
birds could voice had been stilled&mdash;the light in his Erie's
eyes and the low notes from her glad heart.
</p>

<p>
He knew why.  She had told him.  God, Destiny, Fate,
had come between her and the man she loved.  The man
had lost more than life in playing the part of a man.  He
was blind!  Behind him were only memories that could
not be buried.  Before him only darkness, bleakness,
despair.  And he had done an heroic thing in giving her
up.  Helpless, powerless to support her, what else was
there for him to do?  So, in his love for her, he had dug a
grave and in it buried Hope and all that God in His wise
ordinance had allowed him to live and feel.  And they had
kissed and parted, kneeling beside this grave, cold lips to
cold lips, broken heart to broken heart.  It was the kiss on
the cross which each must carry.
</p>

<p>
So much had she told him, and the light had gone from
her eyes, the song from her lips.
</p>

<p>
The sick man sank lower in his chair, his face working,
his heart crying the same pleading cry as cried the heart
of Rachel of old for her children&mdash;a cry understood only
by the heart in which it was born&mdash;and God.
</p>

<p>
And so Hinter found him there before the window in
the gloom, his thin hands clutching the arms of his chair,
his white face sunk on his breast.  "Landon, old friend,
asleep?" he asked softly.  No answer.  Hinter struck a
match and lit the lamp on the table.  Then he touched the
sleeper's arm; still he did not stir.
</p>

<p>
Alarmed, Hinter drew the big chair about so that the
light would fall on the sick man's face.  Slowly Landon
opened his eyes.  He struggled erect and attempted to
speak, but a fit of coughing assailed him and robbed him of
breath.
</p>

<p>
From his pocket Hinter drew a flat bottle and poured a
portion of its contents into a glass.  Gently raising the
emaciated form to a more comfortable position, he held the
glass to the blue lips.  Under the stimulant of the brandy
Landon rallied.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks," he whispered.  Then, hospitality his first
thought, he motioned towards a chair.  Hinter sat down.
</p>

<p>
"Worse than usual tonight, isn't it?" he asked in kindly
tones.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, asthma's that way&mdash;eases off&mdash;then comes back&mdash;hits
you sudden."  He glanced at the bottle.  Hinter,
understanding, poured him out another portion.
</p>

<p>
"It seems to be the only thing that helps," gasped
Landon as he swallowed the draught.
</p>

<p>
Hinter nodded.  "Not a bad medicine if rightly used,"
he said.  He filled his pipe, lit it, and passed the
tobacco-pouch to Landon.  He was watching the door leading to
the inner room.
</p>

<p>
"Erie out in her boat?" he asked, casually.  "I don't
hear her voice, or her whistle."
</p>

<p>
"She's out on the bay," answered the father and lapsed
again into brooding silence.
</p>

<p>
Hinter waited.  At length Landon roused from his
musings.  "My heart's heavy for her," he said, "and heavy
for the young man who loves her.  You've heard, of course.
News of the like spreads quickly."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I've heard."  Hinter rose abruptly and strode to
the window overlooking the bay.  A full moon was lifting
above the pines.  In its silvery track a tiny sail was
beating harborward.
</p>

<p>
After a time he turned and walked back slowly to where
the sick man sat.  "Mr. Landon," he said, gravely, "I
love your daughter.  With your permission I would make
her my wife.  Wait," as the older man attempted to speak.
"Hear what I have to say.  I have endeavored to be honorable.
Never by word or look have I given her to understand
what my feelings are toward her.  For Stanhope, the
man who was brave and strong enough to give her up, I
have always had the deepest respect; and now, knowing the
price he has paid, I honor him.  He was far more worthy
of your daughter than I am.  But now, as all is over
between them, I would do my best to make her happy."
</p>

<p>
"That I know well," spoke the father eagerly.  "Ever
since my clutch on life has been weakenin' I've worried at
the thought that perhaps I may leave her unprovided for.
You have lifted the load, my friend.  I will speak to Erie
and place your proposal of marriage before her.  She's a
good girl; she'll be guided by her father in the matter."
</p>

<p>
Hinter gravely thanked him.  "I would advise that you
say nothing for a time," he said.  "She is high-spirited,
loyal to the core.  She is suffering.  Time will assist us; we
will wait.  I shall visit you oftener than heretofore, but
until I think the moment expedient say nothing to her."
</p>

<p>
A light step sounded on the gravel; the door opened and
Erie entered.  She was dressed in white.  The damp
bay-breeze had kissed the golden hair to shimmering life but
there were shadows beneath the violet eyes, a dreary pathos
about the unsmiling mouth.
</p>

<p>
She placed a cold little hand in the eager one which Hinter
extended to her and her fleeting glance left him to fasten
on the sick man in the arm chair.
</p>

<p>
"Daddy," she cried, running over to kneel beside him.
"It was selfish of me to leave you alone."
</p>

<p>
"I've had our good friend Hinter for company, girlie,"
said her father, stroking the damp curls.
</p>

<p>
Erie flashed their visitor a look of gratitude.  "It is
good of you to come to him," she said.  "He always looks
forward to your visits, and grows quite fretful if you are
late."  She smiled and patted the father's hand.  "The
east wind's bad for the cough but tomorrow you'll be as
good as ever, won't you, Daddy?"
</p>

<p>
Landon did not reply.  He simply pressed the girl's cold
hand.  Hinter caught the look of suffering in her eyes as
she arose and passed into the outer room.  When she
returned she carried a heavy, wicker-bound can.
</p>

<p>
"My lamps need filling," she explained.  "No, please
don't come," as Hinter made to take the can from her, "I
would rather you stayed with him."
</p>

<p>
He bowed, and his eyes followed her from the room.
"What a wonderful creature she is," he thought.
</p>

<p>
"Hinton," Landon's weak voice broke in on his thoughts,
"you haven't given me the neighborhood news.  Have they
found out who robbed the store yet?"
</p>

<p>
"No," answered Hinter, resuming his seat, "I believe
not.  Some were disposed to think that the shoremen had
a hand in the robbery but I don't think so."
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you?  The Sand-sharkers aren't above doin'
it, are they?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I don't say that they are.  That job was not done
by any amateurs, though.  The men who broke into Spencer's
store were old hands at the game.  I was at the store
and had a look over it.  I've seen the work of professional
burglars before.  These fellows made a clean sweep and
left not a single clew.  Still, I made my own deductions.
I can't tell you more until I have proved my suspicions
correct.  Hush!" he warned, "she's coming.  I must be
hitting the trail for the Settlement."
</p>

<p>
As Hinter picked up his hat Erie entered and the light
words he was about to speak died on his lips at sight of
the girl's stricken face.  "You are tired," he said, in deep
concern.  "The work of tending the lights alone is too
much for you.  Why not let me send someone from the
Settlement to help you, at least until your father is strong
enough to take up his end of the work again?"
</p>

<p>
She shook her head.  "The work is not hard and I love
it," she answered.  "After the lights are lit I have nothing
to do.  Daddy's asthma will not let him sleep, so he sits in
his big chair all night and keeps his eye on the light while
I sleep.  Then when the sun sucks up the mists from bay
and lake he is able to get his sleep.  So, you see," smiling
bravely, "we get along splendidly."
</p>

<p>
Hinter held out his hand.  "Well, good night, Miss Erie,"
he said.  "I'll be up again soon, with some books for you."
</p>

<p>
"But you mustn't go without having a cup of tea and
a bite to eat," she protested.  "Please sit down and I'll
have it ready in a minute."
</p>

<p>
He shook his head.  "Not tonight, thanks.  You're tired,
and I've a long ride before me.  Next time I come we'll have
tea," he promised as he turned to shake hands with Landon.
</p>

<p>
"Your guardians are with you I suppose?" said Erie,
as he turned to go.
</p>

<p>
He laughed, "Sphinx and Dexter, you mean?  Yes,
they are out in the stable with my horse.  By the way, they
didn't see you last time we were here, and they seemed to
feel pretty badly about it.  Would you mind stepping
outside and speaking a word to them?" he asked.  "They are
very fond of you, you know."
</p>

<p>
She shivered.  "And I'm very fond of them, only," she
added as she followed him to the door, "I never know
whether they want to eat me up or caress me."
</p>

<p>
"You won't forget to come back again soon, Hinter?"
called the sick man.  "It does me a sight of good to see
you and get the news from the Settlement."
</p>

<p>
"I'll return soon," Hinter promised.  "Don't worry
about anything.  A speedy recovery&mdash;and good night."
</p>

<p>
A full moon was veiling lake and bay in sheen of silvery
whiteness as Hinter and Erie went out into the August
night.  Eastward the long pine covered Point swept a dark
line against the grey, shadowy rush-lands.  Somewhere
among the hidden ponds mallards and grey ducks were
quacking contentedly as they fed.  A swamp coon raised his
almost human cry as he crept the sandy shores in search
of the frogs whose tanging notes boomed from the boglands.
</p>

<p>
Man and girl paused for a little time on the strip of white
sand to drink in the beauty of the night and the sounds of
its wild life.  Then Hinter stepped to the stable and opened
the door.  "Come boys," he commanded and the two
great dogs came bounding out to leap upon him with whines
of welcome, then on to where the girl stood, waiting, half
eagerly, half frightened.
</p>

<p>
"Gently now," Hinter cautioned, and they threw themselves
at her feet, massive heads on outstretched paws,
deep-set eyes raised to her face.  She bent and placed a
hand on the head of each.
</p>

<p>
"Surely," she said, "they are not as ferocious as they
are said to be?"
</p>

<p>
Hinter knit his brows.  "I'm afraid they are," he
answered.  "But my friends are their friends, you see.  There
is only one other person besides yourself and myself who
can do what you are doing now, though."
</p>

<p>
She looked up quickly.  "And may I ask who that is?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly; it's young Billy Wilson.  You know&mdash;the
lad who is always roaming the woods."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she said softly.  "I know him perhaps better
than most folks do.  I am not surprised that he can
handle these dogs, Mr. Hinter."
</p>

<p>
He glanced at her closely, struck by the odd note in her
voice.  "He seems a manly little chap," he said.  "I must
get to know him better."
</p>

<p>
"You may succeed," she replied, "but I'm afraid you
would have to know Billy a long time to know him well."
</p>

<p>
She bent and gave the dogs a farewell pat; then moved
like the spirit of the moonlight to the house.  "Good
night," she called softly from the doorway.
</p>

<p>
"Good night," he echoed.
</p>

<p>
Five minutes later he was riding the two-mile strip of
sand between the light-house and the pines, the Great
Danes close behind.  When he reached the timber he reined
in to look back over his shoulder at the tall white tower with
its ever-sweeping, glowing eye.  Then, with a sigh, he rode
forward and passed into the darkness of the trees.  Half
way down the trail he dismounted and, after hitching his
horse to a tree and commanding his dogs to stand guard,
plunged into the thickly-growing pines on the right of the
path.
</p>

<p>
Half an hour later he came out upon the lake shore.
Quickly he scraped together a pile of drift wood.  He
applied a match to it and as fire leaped up stood frowning
across the water.  Then, as an answering light flashed from
some distance out in the lake, he sighed in relief and
seating himself on the sand lit his pipe.  After a time the
sound of oars fell on his ears.  A boat scraped on the beach.
Two men stepped from it and approached the fire.

CHAPTER XIV
<br /><br />
OLD HARRY TURNS A TRICK
</h3>

<p>
Maurice Keeler, wan, hollow-eyed, and miserable, was
seated on a stool just outside the door in the early morning
sunlight.  Near him sat his mother, peeling potatoes, her
portly form obscured by a trailing wistaria vine.  What
Maurice had endured during his two weeks with the measles
nobody knew but himself.  His days had been lonely, filled
with remorse that he had ever been born to give people
trouble and care; his nights longer even than the days.
Hideous nightmares had robbed him of slumber.  Old
Scroggie's ghost had visited him almost nightly.  The Twin
Oaks robbers, ugly, hairy giants armed with red-hot
pitch-forks, had bound him to a tree and applied fire to his
feet.  What use to struggle or cry aloud for help?  Even
Billy, his dearest chum, had sat and laughed with all the
mouths of his eight heads at his pain.  Of course he had
awakened to learn these were but dreams; but to a boy
dreams are closely akin to reality.
</p>

<p>
And now, after days of loneliness and nights of terror,
Maurice was up again and outside where he could catch the
wood-breeze and smell the sweet odor of plants and clearing
fires.  He wondered how many years he had been away
from it all.  How old was he now?  Why didn't his mother
answer his questions?  He did not realize that his voice was
weak; he had forgotten that his mother was deaf.  All he
knew was that nobody cared a hang for him any more, not
even his own mother.  His weak hands clutched at the
bandage at his throat, as though to tear it off and hurl it
from him.  His head sank weakly back against the wall,
and the tears came to his eyes.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly those eyes opened wide.  Was he dreaming
again or did he hear the low croak of a crow?  He twisted
his head.  There at his feet sat Croaker.  The crow's beady
eyes were fastened on him.  Suspended from its neck was a
cord and attached to the cord was a piece of yellow
wrapping paper.
</p>

<p>
Maurice's white face slowly expanded in a grin.  He
glanced in the direction of his mother, then held out his
hand to the crow with a lowspoken, "Come Croaker, ol'
feller."
</p>

<p>
But Croaker shook his head and backed away, emitting
a string of unintelligible utterances.
</p>

<p>
"Come Croaker," pleaded Maurice again.  But the crow
was obdurate.  It is barely possible that he failed to
recognize Maurice owing to the sick boy's altered looks or
perhaps he expected a glimpse of the reward which was always
his for the performing of a service.  With one backward
look from his bright eyes, he spread his short wings and
sailed across to Mrs. Keeler, settling on her shoulder with
a harsh croak, whereat that greatly-startled lady sat down
on the gravel, her lap full of dirty water and potatoes.
</p>

<p>
What Mrs. Keeler might have done is not known, for
just at this juncture a high-pitched voice came to her from
the garden gate.  "Get hold of him, Missus Keeler an'
wring his black neck."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Keeler, who heard the voice without catching
Mrs. Wilson's words, struggled up.  Croaker promptly sailed
over to Maurice for protection.  The boy broke the string
attached to the note from Billy and reaching behind him
secured from a plate a scrap of the dinner he had left
uneaten.  "Here Croaker," he whispered, "grab it quick.
Now, back you go where things are safe," and he tossed the
bird into the air.  Croaker flew to a tree-top and proceeded
to enjoy the reward of service well rendered.
</p>

<p>
Maurice glanced at the message, then his face fell.  "Oh
blame it all!" he muttered, "another of Bill's sign
letters; looks like a fence that's been struck by lightnin'."
</p>

<p>
The several long perpendicular lines were possibly
intended to represent the forest, but what was meant by the
two vertical lines and the crosses directly beneath them
Maurice did not know.  Also there was a crudely drawn
circle and, inside it, a small square.  Maybe this was supposed
to represent a hollow stump with a squirrel-trap in it,
thought the perplexed Maurice.  With a sigh of disgust he
turned the paper over.  Then his eyes brightened.  Written
there in Billy's cramped hand were these words and
characters:
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-147"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-147.jpg" alt="Billy's message" />
<br />
</p>

<p>
Maurice stared.  So that was it!  Billy and old Harry
had found the goods stolen from the Twin Oaks store.
There were doin's&mdash;big doin's, and Billy wanted him in
on 'em.  He leaned over to secure a view of his mother and
Mrs. Wilson.  Mrs. Keeler had removed her wet apron and
was now seated on the bench beside her neighbor, listening
to the latest gossip.
</p>

<p>
"That Jim Scroggie, the heir, has come back, an' he's
rented the Stanley house," Mrs. Wilson was saying.  "They
say he's goin' to cut down the big woods an' sell the timber.
I guess he intends stayin' right on, 'cause he brought
his housekeeper an' his two children, a boy and a girl, with
him."
</p>

<p>
"Is he tol'able well-to-do?" Mrs. Keeler asked.
</p>

<p>
"Why yes.  I understand he's rich as porcupine stew,"
said Mrs. Wilson.  "What he wants to come here fer,
stirrin' up trouble, is beyond all knowin'.  Him an' that man
Hinter&mdash;they've been trampin' all over the country
examinin' the land, cricks an' everythin'.  They met up with
my man, Tom, on the road yesterday an' they stopped him.
Scroggie told him any time he wanted to bore fer water
he'd put in a rig an' Tom needn't pay a cent if he didn't
get him a well."
</p>

<p>
"Land o' Liberty! but he was generous!" cried Mrs. Keeler.
</p>

<p>
"Tom said he'd think it over an' let him know.  I guess
he was pretty short with Scroggie, knowin' as he does that
the woods an' land rightly belong to young Stanhope."
</p>

<p>
"That it does," agreed Mrs. Keeler, indignantly.  "An'
him, poor young man, helpless through loss of his eyesight
and all.  You heard, of course, that Frank Stanhope and
Erie Landon had broke their engagement?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, everybody who knows 'em both an' loves 'em both
has heard that.  But what else could they do?  He's not
able to support a wife&mdash;the little farm is only enough
fer himself, after that Burke an' his wife are paid fer
workin' it and lookin' after the house, an' he's too
high-spirited to ask Erie to share his burden and poverty."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Keeler gulped and reached for her apron but
recollecting that she had hung it up to dry, rubbed her eyes
on her sleeve.  "Cobin says that young man is jest about
heartbroke, spite o' the smile he wears," she said.  "Tries
so hard to be cheerful, too, in spite of all.  Preacher
Reddick had supper with us last Sunday night an' he said the
teacher was the finest specimen of Christly example he'd
ever seen."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson cleared her throat.  "They do say that
Mr. Hinter visits the light-house regular every week.  Have
you heard that, Missus Keeler?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, an' I'm wonderin' why?"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson rose and smoothed down her skirt.  "Well
I wouldn't go so far as to say I know why, but I have my
suspicions," she declared.  "One thing I do know, it's
not 'cause he's so interested in a man sick with the asthma."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Keeler looked at her sagely.  "Erie would never
marry any man like Hinter," she asserted.
</p>

<p>
"You can't tell what a girl'll do fer her father," said
the other woman dubiously.  "But there now," she broke
off, "here I am visitin' away with you, jest as though
there wasn't a batch of bread riz and kneaded at home,
ready fer the oven.  When I looked fer my bread-pans
blest a one could I find.  I know that Billy has lugged 'em
off somewheres to use as bath-tubs fer his birds and
lizards; so, thinks I, I'll jest run over an' ask Mrs. Keeler
fer the loan of hern."
</p>

<p>
"Why to be sure," rejoined her neighbor, "come right
along in an' I'll get 'em.  I want you to see how nice my
canned tomaters look."  As they turned towards the house,
Mrs. Wilson caught sight of Maurice, huddled in the big
chair beneath the trailing vine.
</p>

<p>
"Well, fer the land sakes alive, Maurice!" she cried.
"It is good to see you up ag'in.  You've had a hard pull of
it, poor lad.  Dear heart! but it's thinned you a lot, too!
Think of any mortal boy changin' so in two short weeks."
</p>

<p>
Maurice squirmed.  "It seemed a lot longer than two
weeks," he said faintly.
</p>

<p>
"There, there," cried the big-hearted woman, "of course
it did."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Keeler edged forward distrustfully.  "What's that
he says he's goin' to do in two weeks?" she asked,
suspicion in her tones.  "Cause if you think, young man, you
be goin' to go in swimmin' ag'in, inside two weeks&mdash;" she
pointedly addressed Maurice, "you got another think
comin'.  I'm goin' to see that you don't suffer no re-lapse."
</p>

<p>
"I don't want to go swimmin'" wailed Maurice, "but
I do want'a walk a bit out through the woods, Ma."
</p>

<p>
"No."  Mrs. Keeler shook her head with finality, "I
can't trust you out o' my sight.  You gotta set right there
where you be."
</p>

<p>
"She don't know how awful lonesome it is settin' still
so long," sighed Maurice, casting an appealing eye on
Billy's mother.  "I wisht you'd ask her to let me go as far
as your place with you, Missus Wilson," he pleaded, lowering
his voice.  "Billy kin trail 'long back with me an' see
I don't cut up any."
</p>

<p>
"Maurice," remonstrated Mrs. Wilson, smothering the
sympathy in her heart in the clutch of duty, "it's wrong
fer you to take advantage of your pore ma's deefness this
way.  I wouldn't send Willium back with you, anyways.
What devilment you wouldn't think of he certainly would.
No, I'll ask your ma to let you come, but it's Anson I'll
have bring you home an' not Willium."  And with a frown
and a shake of her head she followed her neighbor into
the house.
</p>

<p>
Maurice waited hopefully until his mother and Mrs. Wilson
came out again.  Then he turned eagerly towards
them.
</p>

<p>
"Your Ma says you kin come," said Mrs. Wilson, "Providin'
I don't let you near the cookie jar, and see that
Anson brings you back safe."
</p>

<p>
"Mind you," his mother admonished as he followed
Mrs. Wilson down the path, "if you come home with wet feet
into bed you go and stay 'till snow flies."
</p>

<p>
When they reached the meadow-path, with the outbuildings
between them and the watchful eyes of his mother,
Maurice removed the shawl from about his throat.  "I
won't be needin' it any more, now," he said in answer to
his companion's frown of protest.  "It makes me too warm,
an' the doctor he said whatever I did I mustn't
sweat."  Mrs. Wilson allowed the explanation to stand.
</p>

<p>
They climbed the rail fence and started to cross the
stubble-field.  As they neared the long row of brown-fruited
sumachs Mrs. Wilson paused and stood in a listening
attitude.  "Say, isn't that Willium's varmint of a crow
settin' up there on that ash?" she asked, pointing to the
slender tree growing among the sumachs.
</p>

<p>
Maurice shook his head.  "No ma'am, that ain't him,"
he said.  "It's too big fer Croaker; it's a wild crow."
</p>

<p>
"Is it?"  The woman started on again, then halted
abruptly.  "Well, it's queer how much his voice is like
Willium's crow.  Can't you hear him mutterin' and
croakin'?"
</p>

<p>
"Yep, I hear him, but all crows do that," Maurice
hastened to explain.  Then as a shrill note, half a cluck
and half a whistle, sounded from the bushes, he added
quickly.  "That's a hen partridge callin'.  That crow's
tryin' to scare her off her nest, most like, so's he kin steal
the eggs."
</p>

<p>
Again came the low whistle, and Maurice swayed,
staggered and sank down on the stubble, with a faint moan.
With a cry of alarm Mrs. Wilson bent above him.
"Maurice!  Maurice Keeler!" she gasped.  "Whatever is
wrong?  There now, I knowed you was up and out too
soon.  Come along.  I'm goin' to take you straight back
home."
</p>

<p>
"Oh please don't do that," begged Maurice.  "I'm jest
a little weak, that's all.  You leave me here an' send Anse
back to stay with me.  I do so want to go over in the woods
fer a little while, Missus Wilson."
</p>

<p>
The woman stood frowning and considering.  "Well,"
she said at length.  "I'll go an' have Anson come fer you
but you see you don't budge an inch till he comes."
</p>

<p>
"No ma'am, he'll find me right here."
</p>

<p>
Maurice watched her until she climbed the road fence
and entered the grove inside the Wilson gate.  Then he
started crawling towards the sumachs.  As he reached them
Billy poked his head from the bushes, a grin on his face.
</p>

<p>
"Have hard work gettin' away from her, Maurice?" he
asked.
</p>

<p>
"Not very.  Gee!  Bill, it's good to see you ag'in."
</p>

<p>
"It's good to see you too, Maurice.  You got my code
message, didn't you?"
</p>

<p>
"Yep.  Have you found the stuff they stole from the
store, Bill?"
</p>

<p>
"You bet.  Me an' old Harry know right where it is.
We ain't told another soul but you and teacher Stanhope
'bout it yet, but we're goin' to soon.  Come on an' I'll show
you where it's buried."
</p>

<p>
"I can't," said Maurice miserably.  "Your Ma's goin' to
send Anse out to keep tabs on me.  If he wasn't such a
tattletale we might work it but you know him."
</p>

<p>
Billy pursed up his lips in thought.  "Say!" he cried,
"I've got it.  You go on back there where you played
possum, an' wait fer Anse.  When he comes he's goin' to
beg a favor of you, sure as shootin'.  He played a dirty
trick on me not long ago an' he's been keepin' out of my
way ever since.  Lied to me so's to get me to thrash a feller
that licked him.  I'll tell you all about it later.  Anse is
goin' to ask you to square it with me; he's jest that kind.
You promise to get him off this time if he goes away an'
leaves you by yourself.  Then you come back here, see?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but if he goes an' tells your Ma, what then?"
</p>

<p>
"But he won't.  If he does she'll tan him good fer
goin' off an' leavin' you by yourself.  You tell him he'll
have to wait around here till you get back.  He'll do it,
all right.  There he comes through the grove now.  Better
crawl back to where Ma left you."
</p>

<p>
Maurice dropped on all fours and started wriggling
through the rough stubble, sighing in relief as he reached
the desired spot.
</p>

<p>
Anson was grinning as he came up.  "Kind'a weak on
the pins, eh?" he greeted, "Ma told me I was to come
across here an' see you didn't get into no mischief."
</p>

<p>
Maurice wanted to knock that grin off Anson's sneering
mouth, but he was in no condition to do it.  Besides it was
a moment for diplomacy.  "Everybody seems to think I
want'a fall in a well an' get drowned, er somethin'," he
grumbled.  "Why do I need watchin', I'd like to know?"
</p>

<p>
Anson chuckled, "Well, you ain't goin' to get no chance
to do any funny stunts this afternoon," he promised.  "I'm
here to keep an eye on you."
</p>

<p>
"Which one?" Maurice asked sarcastically.  "The good
one er the blacked one?"
</p>

<p>
Anson's face reddened.  "You needn't get funny!" he
cried, angrily.  "Any feller's liable to black an eye runnin'
agin a tree, in the dark."
</p>

<p>
"Or a fist in the daylight," grinned Maurice.  "Well,
never mind, Anse," he said consolingly, "you've got one
good eye left, but somethin' tells me you won't have it
long."
</p>

<p>
"What you mean?" asked Anson suspiciously.
</p>

<p>
"Why, I've got a hunch that somebody's layin' for you,
that's all," answered Maurice.  "'Course, I may be wrong.
Am I?"
</p>

<p>
Anson squatted down beside Maurice.  "No, by gosh!
you're not so far wrong," he admitted, ruefully.  "Somebody
is layin' fer me, an' layin' fer me right.  It's Bill.
Say, Maurice, won't you try an' get him to let me off this
time.  If you will I won't ferget it in a hurry."
</p>

<p>
Maurice stood up.  "Where's Bill now?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"I dunno.  Down where he keeps his pets I s'pose.  Why?"
</p>

<p>
"Cause I'm goin' down an' find him.  I'll beg you off
this time, Anse, if you'll do as I say."
</p>

<p>
"What you mean, do as you say?"
</p>

<p>
"You're to stay here till I get back, no matter how long
I'm away."
</p>

<p>
Anson considered.  "An' you promise to get Bill to let
me off?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure."
</p>

<p>
"All right, I'll stay."
</p>

<p>
"Course, if you ain't here when I get back the bargain's
off.  Understand?"
</p>

<p>
Anson nodded.  "I'll be here," he promised.
</p>

<p>
"Bill won't bother you none if you do what I say," said
Maurice as he made for the grove.  Half an hour later he
and Billy approached old Harry's hut and knocked gently
on the door.  Harry's voice bade them enter.
</p>

<p>
They found him seated on a stool, fondling the big grey-blue
cat.  He placed the cat gently down as they entered.
</p>

<p>
"God love ye, byes," he cried, "it's a foine pair ye are,
an' no mistake; so it's sick y've been, Maurice?"
</p>

<p>
"Measles," said Maurice.
</p>

<p>
Harry nodded sympathetically.  "Faith, measles are a
blissin' in disguise, as are many other afflictions," he said.
"Would ye relish a swate smell and the colors av God's
big out av doors so much, think ye, if kept prisoner from
thim ye never were?  I'm thinkin' not.
</p>

<p>
"Take meself," he went on, drawing his stool closer to
the chairs of his young friends.  "All me life have I
dhrunk more er less av the cup that cheers; but I'm
through now, byes, not so much either because ut's a fit av
the blue divils the stuff give me but because I mane from
now on to quaff the swate draft of Nature widout a bad
taste in me mouth.  I'm through wid whisky feriver, and
ut's Harry O'Dule, siventh son av a siventh son, so declares
himself this day.  Ut's out into God's blissid sunlight have
I come afther bein' held prisoner by a deadlier disease
than measles, me byes."
</p>

<p>
The tears came to the old man's eyes as he felt the sincere
pressure of the hands held out to him.  "Begobs! but
ut's a foine pair ye be," he muttered.  Then aloud.  "And
have ye told him, Billy?"
</p>

<p>
Billy nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Well, this much more I'll be tellin' both av ye," said
Harry.  "Just a bit ago two strange min stopped at me
cabin dure.  A rough lookin' pair they were, I'm sayin'.
Says the big one av the two: 'Ould man,' says he, 'do
ye know wan in these parts named Hinter?'"
</p>

<p>
"'I know one such,' 'sez I.
</p>

<p>
"'Then,' sez he, 'wull yu do me the favor av deliverin'
a missage to him an' kin ye go now?' says he.
</p>

<p>
"'I kin that,' says I."
</p>

<p>
"'And the message,' he says, 'this is ut: "Off
Gibson's Grove at tin o'clock,"' says he."
</p>

<p>
"'All right,' says I, and he put a silver dollar in me
fist and wint away wid his companion.
</p>

<p>
"I delivered the missage to Hinter.  And whin I
returned to me cabin I found everythin' in a jumble, an'
no mistake.  Somebody had scattered the furs on me bunk
and turned everythin' upside down, they had, an' they had
sought underneath the flure, too."
</p>

<p>
"An' did they find it?" gasped Billy.
</p>

<p>
"Begobs they did not," grinned Harry.  "And I'll be
tellin' ye fer why.  Only this blissid mornin', uts took the
stuff from beneath me flure, I did, and hid it in a new
spot."
</p>

<p>
Billy sighed his relief.  "Gee, but it's lucky you did,"
he cried.  "That's the very thing Trigger Finger Tim
would'a done, ain't it, Maurice?"
</p>

<p>
Maurice nodded.  "I'm goin' to stick along here an help
you watch the stuff, Harry.  Them men'll likely come
prowlin' back here."
</p>

<p>
"An' torture you, Harry," put in Billy.  "Tie you to
a tree an' throw knives at you till you weaken an' tell 'em
where the stuff's hid.  That's what they did to Trigger
Finger."
</p>

<p>
"Faith," cried Harry, "ut's divil a bit I know
concernin' that man Trigger Finger, but ut's small reward
they'd be gettin' fer their pains if they tied me up and
tried torture, an' I'll be tellin' ye fer why, byes.  The
stuff's gone back to Spencer.  Load ut I did meself on Joe
Scraff's buckboard, not more than an hour agone.  The box
wid the black fox skins an' two big jugs av whisky.  Back
I sent ut all, byes, wid the compliments av the both av ye
an' me poor self.  But now it'll be there, and the heart
av ould Caleb'll be beatin' two skips fer one wid jye at
recoverin' all av his stolen possessions.  I did right, I hope
now, in sindin' ut along back?" he finished.
</p>

<p>
"You bet you did!" cried the boys, together.
</p>

<p>
Maurice stood up.  "Well, as there's no need to keep
watch here, maybe I best trail along home.  Anse'll be
gettin' tired waitin' fer me."
</p>

<p>
"That won't hurt him; he's always tired anyway,"
rejoined Billy.  "But we'd best go."
</p>

<p>
At the door he paused and turned toward Harry.
"Where's Gibson's Grove?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
Harry, who had picked up his hat and taken his tin
whistle from his bosom, shook his head.  "There's no sech
place, I'm thinkin'," he answered.
</p>

<p>
Billy frowned.  "What did Hinter say when you gave
him the message, Harry?"
</p>

<p>
Harry chuckled.  "Faith, ut's crazy he thought I was
I guess," he cried.  "'Ould man,' sez he, 'somebody has
been playin' a trick on ye.  I know no such place as
Gibson's Grove.'  Thin begobs! he laughed, like he saw the
humor av ut, and had me sate meself in the shade and
smoke a cigar while I risted.  So I'm thinkin', byes, them
min jest wanted to get rid av me the while they ransacked
me house and belongin's, bad cess to 'em!"
</p>

<p>
Billy laughed.  "Come along as far as the clearin',
Harry," he invited, "and play us a tune that'll cheer
Maurice up, will you?"
</p>

<p>
"Faith, an' that I'll do," cried O'Dule.  "Lilt him a
chune I wull that'll make his laggin' feet dance, and his
laggin' spirit look up above the slough av despond."
</p>

<p>
And so down the path ridged with the bronze bars of
late afternoon sunlight, they passed, Harry strutting in
the lead, wrinkled face lifted, scanty white locks streaming
in the breeze as he drew from his whistle a wild sweet
melody.
</p>

<p>
"There now," he cried, when at last the clearing was
reached, and the whistle was tucked away in the bosom
of his flannel shirt, "I'll be partin' wid ye now, byes, fer
a spell.  Over to Spencer's store I'll be goin', to glimpse the
jye in his eyes, and axe him to trust me fer a few groceries
I'll be needin' till me next allowance arrives from the home
land.  And ut's no doubt I have in me mind that he'll do
ut gladly, fer ut's a tinder man he is at heart an' no
mistake."

<h3>
CHAPTER XV
<br /><br />
BILLY'S PROBLEMS MULTIPLY
</h3>

<p>
Recovery of the stolen goods caused considerable excitement
in the Settlement.  For a week or so nothing else was
talked of and conjecture ran rife as to why the thieves had
not made off with their pillage rather than hide it in the
haunted house.  Harry O'Dule came in for a plenty of
praise for the part he had played in finding the loot but
beyond hinting that the job had been more than easy for
the seventh son of a seventh son, he was reticent on the
subject.  That he should have returned the liquor almost
intact, to the owner, was a conundrum to all who knew
him, with the exception of Billy and Maurice.
</p>

<p>
Billy was anything but easy in his mind during these
exciting days.  Who were the two strangers who had
searched old Harry's hut?  Were they the same two he
and Maurice had seen in the woods on the night of the
storm?  If so, why did they send a message to Hinter, and
what was its significance?  Where was Gibson's Grove,
anyway?  These questions bothered him, and pondering
upon them robbed him of appetite and sleep.  Maurice and
Elgin were no help to him in a dilemma of this kind and
the new boy, Jim Scroggie, he knew scarcely well enough
to trust.
</p>

<p>
It was, perhaps, just as well for Anson that he kept out
of Billy's way during this period.  However very little that
Billy did was missed by his pale blue eyes.  He knew that
his step-brother had visited the haunted house alone and
had searched it nook and corner.  For what?  He had seen
him fasten his rabbit-foot to a branch of a tree and dig,
and dig.  For what?  He wanted to find out but dared not
ask.  Perhaps Billy was going crazy!  He acted like it.
Anson made up his mind that he would confide his
suspicions in his mother.  But on the very day that he had
decided to pour into Mrs. Wilson's ear all the strange
goings-on of his brother, Billy caught him out on a
forest-path alone and, gripping him by the shoulder, threatened
to conjure up by means of witchcraft at his command a
seven-headed dragon with cat-fish hooks for claws who
would rip his&mdash;Anson's&mdash;soul to shreds if he so much as
breathed to his mother one word of what he had seen.
</p>

<p>
In vain Anson declared he didn't know anything to tell.
Billy looked at him calmly.  "You been follerin' me an' I
know it," he said.  "Croaker saw you, an' so did Ringdo."
</p>

<p>
Anson's mouth fell open in terror.  "You don't
mean&mdash;" he commenced, then gulped, unable to proceed.
</p>

<p>
"That Croaker's a witch?  Of course he's a witch, an'
so's Ringdo.  They both know exactly what you're thinkin',
an' what you're doin'.  Listen, you," as Anse shivered.
"Didn't you dream, jest t'other night, that Croaker was
bendin' over you to peck your eyes out?"
</p>

<p>
Anse nodded a reluctant admission.
</p>

<p>
"Well, s'pose it wasn't any dream?  S'pose it was all
real?  An' s'pose, if I hadn't waked up in time to stop
him, he'd have picked your eyes out an' put in fisheyes in
their place?  Then you couldn't see anythin' unless you
was under water.  An' s'pose, when I asked Croaker what
he wanted to do that awful thing fer, he up an' told me
that you'd been spyin' on me an' you didn't deserve to
own human eyes?  I say s'pose all this.  Now then, Anse,
you best mind your own business an' let your mouth freeze
up close, else you're goin' to have an awful time of it.  If
I get Croaker to say he won't gouge your eyes out till I
give the word it's more'n you deserve."
</p>

<p>
Hope stirred in Anson's fear ridden soul&mdash;hope which
Billy remorselessly killed with his next words.
</p>

<p>
"But I couldn't get no promise out o' Ringdo.  He says
you're workin' 'gainst us."
</p>

<p>
"But I ain't, Bill.  Cross my heart, I ain't," protested
Anson.  "Why should I be?"
</p>

<p>
"Maybe jest 'cause you're a sneak," Billy answered,
"but you're my brother an' I don't want anythin' horrible
to happen to you if I kin help it.  The best thing fer you
to do is keep mum, an' when you see me strikin' off
anywhere look t'other way."
</p>

<p>
"An' you'll see that Ringdo don't bite me, Bill?"
pleaded Anson.  "You'll keep him off me, won't you?"
</p>

<p>
Billy considered.  "I'll try," he promised, "but it's
goin' to take a whole lot of coaxin' to do it.  That old
witchcoon has been prowlin' down through the tamarack
swale huntin' copperhead snakes for a week now, gettin'
ready to do fer somebody er other."
</p>

<p>
"Oh gollies!" gasped Anson.  "What's he huntin'
copperheads fer, Bill?"
</p>

<p>
"Why to poison his teeth with.  He's loadin' up fer
somebody, sure as shootin'.  Gosh!  I am sorry you've been
sech a fool, Anse.  Jest think, one little scratch from that
coon's teeth and&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
"Bill," Anson's voice was husky with terror.  "You
won't let him touch me, will you, Bill?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll keep him away from you so long as you keep away
from us, an' hold a close tongue in your head," Billy
promised.  "Understan', though, it's goin' to be a mighty hard
thing to do; I saw him trying the bark of that elm jest
under our winder only this mornin'.  He's likely aimin' to
shin up that tree an' fall on your face, most any night, so
if you want your eyes an' your life you'd better do what
I say."
</p>

<p>
"I'll do jest as you say, Bill," Anse promised, fervently,
and Billy knew that he meant it.  "All right, that's a go,"
he said and went off to the menagerie to feed his pets.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
Something else was to happen shortly to make Billy feel
that his world was full of mysterious agents sent for no
other purpose than to give him fresh worries.
</p>

<p>
That evening, as he drove the cattle down along the
Causeway for water he met two teams of horses hauling
loads of greasy-looking timbers and black, oily pipes.  The
men who drove the teams were strangers to him.  Scroggie,
or Heir Scroggie, as he was now commonly called in the
neighborhood, sat beside the driver of one of the wagons.
</p>

<p>
"He's movin' a saw-mill up into the big woods," thought
Billy.  "But where in the world did it come from!" he
pondered as he looked after the creaking loads.
</p>

<p>
He was not long to remain in doubt on that point.  As
he approached the lake road another load of timbers and
metal rounded the corner.  Two men were seated on the
load, a big, broad-shouldered man and a thin one.  Some
little distance behind another man was walking.  It was
Hinter.
</p>

<p>
As the load drew close to where Billy stood partly
concealed by a clump of red willows, the driver halted his
team for a rest after the pull through the heavy sand, and
apparently not noticing the boy, spoke in guarded tones to
his companion.
</p>

<p>
"If I had only listened to you, Jack, we wouldn't have
lost that whisky," he said.  "I was dead sure nobody would
go near that place.  And at that we didn't find what we did
the job to get, did we?  It'll be just our luck to have that
will turn up in time to cook our goose, yet."
</p>

<p>
"Well, Tom, I reckon it's none of our funeral whether
it turns up or not," growled the other.  "We're gettin'
paid well fer what we're doin', ain't we?  If it turns up,
Scroggie and the boss'll have to do their own worryin'."
</p>

<p>
The driver cracked his whip and the load went on, swaying
and creaking as it left the soft sand for the corduroy.
</p>

<p>
A little further on Billy came face to face with Hinter.
"How are you, Billy?" spoke the man, pleasantly.  "Still
driving the cows down to the lake for water, I see."
</p>

<p>
"Yep; they don't seem to take to the crick water,"
Billy replied.  "It's sort of scummy an' smells queer."
</p>

<p>
Hinter laughed constrainedly.  "I've been pretty well
through the Settlement, and most of the creeks are like
that," he replied.  "What do you suppose causes that scum
and that peculiar odor?" he asked, casually.
</p>

<p>
The boy shook his head.  "I dunno; them cricks shouldn't
be that way; they're all spring-fed.  Maybe you know?"
looking straight into Hinter's eyes.
</p>

<p>
"No," said Hinter, startled at the directness of look
and question.  "I don't know."
</p>

<p>
He turned abruptly away to follow the wagons but
Billy's voice stopped him.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Hinter, where did that stuff on them wagons come
from?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, it belongs to Mr. Scroggie," Hinter answered.
"It was brought across from Ohio by schooner.  You know
what it is, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"I take it it's machinery an' stuff for a saw-mill,"
answered Billy moodily.  "Is it?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  It's a couple of boring rigs, Billy.  Mr. Scroggie
is going to earn the good will of all of us here by boring for
water and giving us fine wells on our farms.  Don't you
think that is mighty good of him?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir.  If we had a good well I wouldn't have to
drive the cows down to the lake every night, like this."
</p>

<p>
"That's so, Billy."  Hinter laughed and slapped the
lad's shoulder.  "Well I'll see that he bores on your
daddy's farm just as soon as he strikes water on his own.
I intend to help him get started, because I think it's going
to be a good thing for everybody.  Besides, I know boring-rigs
from bit to derrick.  It's my trade, you see."
</p>

<p>
Billy nodded.  "An' is the schooner still anchored off
here?" he asked.  "I might take a fish-boat an' row out
to her, if she is."
</p>

<p>
"No," Hinter answered.  "She didn't anchor off here;
water's too shallow.  She anchored off Gibson's Grove, five
miles up the point.  She's on her way back to Cleveland
by now."
</p>

<p>
He was already several paces away, anxious to overtake
the wagon.  Billy stood looking after him, a frown on his
brow.  "Gibson's Grove," he repeated.  "So that's where
Gibson's Grove is!"  Then the message which the strangers
had sent by old Harry might have had some significance,
after all.
</p>

<p>
Billy passed on slowly after his cows, up through the
spicy pines to the pebbled beach of the lake, pondering for
a solution to the biggest problem his young mind had ever
had to wrestle with.  He seated himself on the prow of the
big fish-boat, his eyes on the thirsty cattle now belly-deep
in the blue water, drinking their fill.  Along the shore stood
the big reels used for holding the seines and nets when not
in use.  The twine had been newly coal-tarred and the
pungent odor of the tar mingled pleasingly with the breath
of pine and the sweet freshness of the sun-warmed water.
</p>

<p>
Billy's eyes strayed to those reels and he sighed to think
that the washing and retarring of the nets was just another
sign that the glad summer holidays would soon be over and
the drab days of fall&mdash;and school&mdash;would soon be there.
A low-flying flock of black ducks passed over his head in
flight from the lake's bosom where they had rested through
the day to the marsh feeding grounds across the point, and
the shadow passed from the boy's face.
</p>

<p>
After all fall had its compensations.  Glorious days
beneath lowering skies in a wind-whipped blind were
before him; stormy days when the ducks would sweep in to
his decoys and his old "double-barrel" would take toll.
If only Frank Stanhope was to be the teacher instead of
that cold-eyed, mean looking Johnston.  He knew he would
not get along with Johnston.  And school was to open on
Monday.  Great Scott!  The very thought made him shiver.
</p>

<p>
The cows waded to shore slowly, pausing to brush the
troublesome flies from bulging sides with moist noses,
halting to drink again and again, loath to leave this great
body of cool delicious water.  Billy did not hurry them.
He thought he understood their feelings in the matter.  It
would be a long while before they would have a chance to
drink again.  It must be awful, he reasoned, to have to do
without a drink so long.  The thought made him thirsty.
With his hands he scooped a hole close to the edge of the
lake, and slowly the miniature well filled with milky water,
which immediately cleared, and lay before him limpid and
sweet and fit for king or thirsty boy.
</p>

<p>
He stretched himself full length on the sand, and drank.
When he arose, wiping his mouth, the cows had moved off
lazily towards the Causeway.  Billy did not follow at once.
He did not want to miss the dance of the fire-flies above
the darkening marsh along the Causeway, the twilight
blush on the pine tips of Point Aux forest, the light-house
gleam, nor the prayer-time hush of the mystery-filled
rush-land.  So he tarried beside the lake until the pines
and cedars had melted into indistinct masses and the call
of the whip-poor-will sounded faintly from far away.  Then
he turned homeward.
</p>

<p>
As he left the pine grove for the main road he discerned
a lone figure standing on the Causeway, with head lifted
and turned towards the still faintly glowing west, and his
footsteps quickened.
</p>

<p>
"Teacher," he cried in surprise, "you here?"
</p>

<p>
Frank Stanhope turned slowly and held out his hands.
</p>

<p>
"Billy Boy," he said, with a smile, "I had to come, at
last.  Every time you have offered to guide me to this old
spot we knew and loved and enjoyed together I have
refused because&mdash;because I thought I couldn't stand it:
because I am unable to see what my heart and senses tell
me is here.  But tonight I groped my way down, knowing
that you would find me and help me home."
</p>

<p>
He placed his hand on Billy's shoulder, and turned once
again toward the bay.  "I am blind," he said, softly,
"but I can tell you how it looks across yonder.  There's a
white splash of water between deep shadows, and there's
just a faint tinge of crimson above the tree-tops.  The mist
is rising off the marsh; the fire-flies are playing cross-tag
above the cat-tails.  The light-house&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He paused abruptly, and the boy felt the hand on his
shoulder tremble.
</p>

<p>
"You tell me, Billy," he said huskily&mdash;"tell me if the
light shines as brightly as when we watched it together."
</p>

<p>
"Why, teacher, it's jest as bright as ever," cried the
boy.  "It fair seems to laugh as it swings 'round an'
jumps down the bay like a long, white arm."
</p>

<p>
"Does it, Billy, does it?" cried the man, eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"Yep, an' everythin' else is jest like you said, too, only
the red streaks have gone from above the trees now."
</p>

<p>
"But the light is the same, isn't it, Billy?"
</p>

<p>
"Jest the same as ever.  There, teacher, it fair laughed
right out at us then."
</p>

<p>
"Did it, Billy, did it?  And is my face turned towards
it now, Billy?"
</p>

<p>
"Not quite.  There, now you are facin' it."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks.  Now you mustn't tell me when it comes again&mdash;the
light&mdash;I want to see if I can feel it.  I hope&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He caught his breath and stood with lifted face, as the
white light swept it, lingered on it, drew from it reluctantly.
</p>

<p>
"Thank God," he whispered, and stood trembling.
Then, as though to himself, he said softly: "It is as though
her soft hand touched these eyes that will never see again."
</p>

<p>
Then, as the first note of a night-bird came soft and
fluted from a distant willow copse, Billy took his hand and
drew him up along the corduroy road stretching through
the shadows.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI
<br /><br />
BILLY MEETS A DIVINITY
</h3>

<p>
Billy spent the days preceding the reopening of the
Valley School much as a criminal awaiting execution might
spend his last hours of life.  The fact that Trigger Finger
Tim had always accepted the inevitable sentence of fate
with calm and undaunted spirit was the one buoy to which
he might cling in a turbulent sea of uncertainty.  There
had been so much to do; so little had been done.  The
hiding place of old Scroggie's will was still a secret; no
check had been put upon the preparations of the interloper
who claimed to be the heir of the Scroggie estate;
the mystery surrounding the store robbery remained a
mystery; his friend Frank Stanhope was growing thin and
pale from secret suffering.  And on Monday morning the
Valley School would open!
</p>

<p>
It was tough!  Billy felt sure that had he been allowed
a little more time he might have solved one or more of the
problems which weighed him down.  He felt like a man
who was being cut suddenly off from his usefulness.
Saturday he spent roaming the big woods alone.  On
Saturday evening Maurice came over and the two went down to
Levee Creek, set sail in the old punt and steered up-bay
towards the light-house.
</p>

<p>
Arriving they found Hinter there, so did not remain
long.  It was while Erie Landon was preparing a lunch
for them that Billy got an opportunity to whisper something
in her ear.  The girl's cheeks flushed and her blue
eyes grew deep with feeling.
</p>

<p>
"You tell him, Billy Boy, that the light he feels is my
promise of fidelity," she said softly, "my love, my prayers,
my hope.  And tell him that I know all will be well."
</p>

<p>
That night, after separating from Maurice, Billy went
over to the Stanhope cottage.  It was late but Frank
Stanhope was standing beside the white gate, his arms folded
on its top, his chin upon them.
</p>

<p>
He raised his face at sound of the boy's step.  "Ho,
Billy!" he called cheerfully.  "Is it you?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, teacher."  Billy came close to him and the two
stood for a long time in the silence of mute understanding.
Then the boy delivered the message just as Erie had
whispered it.  Stanhope did not speak.  He simply lifted his
face to the stars, eyes streaming, lips moving dumbly.
Billy moved softly away through the shadows.
</p>

<p>
Next day was Sunday and Billy did not like Sundays.
They meant the scrubbing of his face, ears and neck with
"Old Brown Windsor" soap until it fairly cracked if he
so much as smiled, and being lugged off with his parents
and Anse to early forenoon Sunday School in the little
frame church in the Valley.  There was nothing interesting
about Sunday School; it was the same old hum-drum over
and over again&mdash;same lessons, same teachers, same hymns,
same tunes; with Deacon Ringold's assertive voice cutting
in above all the other voices both in lessons and singing
and with Mrs. Scraff's shrill treble reciting, for her class's
edification, her pet verse: "Am I nothing to thee, all ye
who pass by?"&mdash;only Mrs. Scraff always improvised more
or less on the scriptures, and usually threw the verse
defiantly from her in this form: "You ain't nuthin to me,
all you who pass me by."
</p>

<p>
Billy knew exactly what he was going to hear at Sunday
School, and what he was going to see, and there wasn't
much of interest in that for a live boy.  Consequently he
was quite unprepared for the unexpected shock he received
on this particular morning, when he trailed dejectedly into
the Sunday School room behind his mother and Anson.
</p>

<p>
As he passed up the aisle something strange and mysterious
seemed to draw his eyes toward a certain spot.  He
looked and there, gazing at him from eyes of blue,
rose-bud lips half parted in a smile, was a girl&mdash;and such a
girl!
</p>

<p>
Billy stood stock still in the aisle and stared at the vision
of loveliness.  She was dressed in white and her hair was
curly and as golden as that of the pictured angel in his
mother's Bible.  Never before had he seen such a gloriously
beautiful creature.
</p>

<p>
He became conscious that the droning hum of teachers
and classes had given place to hushed calm; that all eyes
were turned upon him, standing there in the aisle and
staring at this picture of absolute perfection.  With an
effort he drew his eyes away and stumbled forward to his
place in elass.
</p>

<p>
Several times during the next half hour Billy, allowing
his gaze to wander across the church, caught those blue
eyes fastened upon him and his heart began to flutter
strangely.  An ungovernable desire to misbehave himself
took possession of him.  Never in his life had his head felt
so light&mdash;unless it was the night when he and Maurice
had inadvertently mistaken hard cider for sweet and had
nearly disgraced themselves.  He was not even aware of
who was beside him on his seat, until a pair of stubby
fingers pinched his leg and he came down to earth to look
into Jim Scroggie's grinning face.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, hello," he whispered, coldly.  He was irritated at
such unwarranted interruption of his soul-feast.  He settled
low in his seat and pretended to give his attention to the
teacher, Cobin Keeler.
</p>

<p>
Tim nudged him.  "What you think of her?" he asked
proudly.
</p>

<p>
Billy frowned.  "Who?"
</p>

<p>
Jim nodded across to the girl in white.  "That's Lou,"
he informed Billy, "my sister."
</p>

<p>
Billy gave such a perceptible start that he knocked the
"Sunday Lesson Helps" sheet out of the hands of Elgin
Scraff, on his left.  That this snub-nosed, flat-faced, beefy
boy beside him could possibly be a brother to the dainty,
angelic creature who had caused his heart to turn such
violent flip-flops and disorganize his whole mental poise
was inconceivable.
</p>

<p>
And still, it must be true.  Immediately his manner
towards Scroggie underwent a change.  All the antipathy
that a woods-born boy can feel toward a city-bred one
vanished suddenly at the intelligence imparted to him.  It
was the look of true comradeship, the smile that always
won him confidence and fidelity, that he gave Jim now, as
he whispered: "Any time you want'a borrie my shot-gun,
Jim, jest let me know."
</p>

<p>
Scroggie beamed.  Being the son of his father he lacked
nothing in astuteness.  He realized, as all brothers realize
sooner or later, that a pretty sister is an asset.
</p>

<p>
"An' the punt too?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
Billy nodded.  Jim, had he but known it, might have
had everything Billy owned, including Croaker, Ringdo,
Moll and the pups.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Keeler had finished the reading of the lesson, skipping
most of the big words and laying particular stress on
those he was sure of, and had stood up facing his class of
boys, to ask them certain questions pertaining to the lesson,
thereby bringing all whispered conversation to a halt.  He
cleared his throat and ran a critical eye down the line of
upturned faces.  When Mr. Keeler asked a question it was
in a booming voice that carried from pulpit to ante-room
of the building.
</p>

<p>
"Kin any boy in this here class tell me why Christ
walked on the sea of Galilee?" he now asked.
</p>

<p>
Nobody answered.  Billy, casting a quick glance across
the aisle, found Lou Scroggie's blue eyes watching him
intently.  They seemed to say "Surely, you can answer
that."
</p>

<p>
Billy shifted uneasily in his seat.  He was sorry now
that he had not paid closer attention to the reading of the
lesson.
</p>

<p>
"Why did Christ walk on the sea of Galilee?" repeated
Mr. Keeler, folding his arms impressively and looking
hard at Billy, who once more shot a side-long glance across
the room.  The blue eyes were wide open with wonder and
astonishment now, that he could not answer so simple a
question as that.  Billy's mind worked with lightning
speed.  He would answer that question if it cost him his
life.  Promptly he stood up.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Keeler looked surprised; so did Billy's class-mates;
so did all members of all the classes and the teachers.  So
did Billy himself.  The drowsy hum of reciting voices
died suddenly and a great stillness succeeded it.  It seemed
to Billy that he was standing alone on top of a flimsy
scaffold, hundreds of feet in the air, waiting for
Mr. Keeler, high executioner, to spring the trap-door that
would launch him into oblivion.
</p>

<p>
He glanced at the window.  It was raised but a few
inches; exit was effectively closed in that direction.  He
made up his mind to reach for his hat and walk with
dignity from the class, the church and those soulless,
sinister-faced people who watched and waited gloatingly for his
downfall.  No, there was still a better plan.  He would
stagger and grope his way out like one who had been
suddenly stricken with sickness.  Yes, that was what he
would do.
</p>

<p>
Then through the haze of uncertainty two wide blue eyes
seemed to meet his own; eyes that smiled to him confidence
in his ability to make good; eyes that said as plainly as
words: "I knew you could do it."
</p>

<p>
Billy braced himself.  At the same time he caught a
glimpse of Anson's leering face and inwardly vowed that
that young man should have plenty of reason to regret
that leer.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Keeler was leaning across the back of the long seat,
smiling commendingly upon him.
</p>

<p>
"William Wilson will tell us why Christ walked on the
sea of Galilee," he boomed.  "Come William, answer up,
my boy."
</p>

<p>
Billy drew in his breath hard.  He fully intended that
none of those straining ears should miss his answer.
Suddenly it had come to him that it was an easy question to
answer; there could in fact be but one answer to it.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Because He didn't have no boat!</i>"
</p>

<p>
In the deep silence following his answer Billy sat down.
Then a murmur of gasps, whispers and giggles grew up,
which died suddenly to silence again, as Mr. Keeler's voice
rang out.
</p>

<p>
"Correct!  Now, boys, we will get on with our lesson."
</p>

<p>
During the closing hymn Billy managed to evade the
eyes of his elders long enough to slip outside.  He wanted
to be alone&mdash;alone to ponder over this great and wonderful
thing that had come into his life.  It was love&mdash;yes it
certainly was love, strong worshipful love such as comes
to but few, and to those few only once.  Such love had
made Trigger Finger Tim leap a fifty-foot chasm, swim
a swift, ice-encumbered river and fight single-handed a
band of painted savages to free his sweetheart from their
murderous clutches.  Billy knew that he would do as much
for <i>her</i>!
</p>

<p>
He strayed into the beech grove sighing, striving to
realize all that had suddenly happened to him.  Never in
all his dreams had he imagined such a face could belong
to mortal girl.  He must see her again&mdash;yes, he must see
her soon again&mdash;perhaps speak with her.  The very
thought of it made him dizzy.
</p>

<p>
He wanted to tear up a sapling by the roots and bust
something with it, wanted to shout, wanted to let all the
world know his joy.  But he didn't.  He compromised by
standing on his head and walking the full length of the
mossy grove on his hands.
</p>

<p>
That day at dinner for the first time in his life he found
it impossible to eat.  Food choked him.  He left the others
eating, with a word or two about having eaten heartily of
thimble-berries and not caring for anything more.
</p>

<p>
Out in the shed he found Moll, anxious over one of her
pups which seemed stupid and sick.  Billy picked up the
pup and cuddled it.  He found himself crying over its
sniffling whimpers of pain.  Love is a grand thing if only
because of the softening influence it exerts in the savage
breast of man.  Billy could not remember ever having
actually cried over a sick puppy before.  It was as though
she stood there, white hands clasped, blue eyes filled with
commiseration, the gold of her hair forming a halo above
her bent head.  He could almost hear her voice saying:
"Great, tender heart, cease thy tears.  Am I not close
beside thee to help thee bear thy sorrow?"  That's what
Avilee Rochaw had said to Trigger Finger, in the book.
</p>

<p>
He put the pup tenderly down beside its mother and
went out behind the wood-pile to wait for Anse.  He
wanted to tell him that he forgave him for being such a
low-down tattle-tale and the meanest brother that ever
lived.  That's what <i>she</i> would have him do, he knew.  He
was a changed being.  If he was to win her love, he was
going to be worthy.
</p>

<p>
He waited for an hour but Anson did not come.  How
was he to know that Billy had undergone a change of
heart?  Had he not caught the cold glint in Billy's eyes,
when he had sneered at him in the class?  Previous
experiences had taught him caution.  He had watched his
brother go out behind the wood-pile and had promptly
made tracks in the opposite direction.
</p>

<p>
At supper time Billy's appetite had not returned.  He
did make something of a pretense at eating but it did not
deceive the eyes of his watchful mother, who for reasons
of her own restrained herself from making any reference
to his mopishness.
</p>

<p>
That night as he was undressing for bed Mrs. Wilson
came softly up the stairs, a tumbler half filled with a
smoky liquid in one hand, a black strap in the other.
</p>

<p>
"Here, you Willium," she commanded, "you drink
these here salts and not a word out o' you, or I'll tan you
good and plenty."
</p>

<p>
Billy turned slowly, his fingers fumbling with his cotton
braces.  He looked at the noxious dose in the tumbler, then
at his mother's face.  "All right," he said gently, "I'll
take 'em, Ma; give 'em here."
</p>

<p>
His mother gasped.  Whatever was coming over the boy,
she wondered.  Never before had she been able to get a
dose of medicine down him without a struggle.  There
could be only one answer.  He was sick&mdash;sicker than he
let on.
</p>

<p>
She set the glass on the little table and let the strap
slip to the floor.  She put her hands on his shoulders and
turned him about so that the light fell full on his face.
She saw that it was really pale&mdash;yes, and wistful.  Anse
had told her about having seen Billy kiss the pup and cry
over it.  Now a lump came into her throat as she looked
into the grey, unwavering eyes.  With a sob, she threw
her arms about his neck and drew him close to her.  Billy
patted her shoulder and let her cry.  He could not guess
her reason for it, but for that matter he could not understand
why he was crying too, unless indeed it was his great
and worshipful love still working overtime.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson subsided at last and wiped her eyes on her
apron.  Then she took Billy's face between her hands and
kissed him on the freckled nose.  "I know how much you
miss your own Ma, Willium," she said, "and I know I
kin never take her place, but I love you, an' it worries me
awful to think anythin' might happen to you."
</p>

<p>
"Nuthin's goin' to happen to me, Ma," Billy assured
her.  "I'm feelin' bully.  Don't you worry none."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson sighed.  "Well, if you're sure you don't
need these here salts&mdash;" she lifted the glass and stood
hesitating, "why, I don't s'pose there's re'lly any call
fer you to take 'em.  It seems too bad to waste 'em,
though."
</p>

<p>
Billy turned toward Anson's bed, from which, for the
second time, he was sure had come a faint titter.  "I was
thinkin'," he said in answer to his mother's quick look,
"that it wouldn't hurt Anse none to have a dose.  He does
grit his teeth somethin' awful when he's asleep."
</p>

<p>
"You don't tell me, Willium!  Why then, salts is jest
what he needs.  I'll wake him up an' give 'em to him."
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
It was long after his mother had left the loft and Anse's
wails of protest and wild promises of vengeance had given
place to the regular breathing of peaceful sleep that Billy
lay awake, gazing wide-eyed through the dark.
</p>

<p>
Above him bent a face with tender blue eyes and red,
half-smiling lips beneath a crowning glory as golden as
frost-pinched maple leaf.  And she would be at school in
the morning!  It was while pondering on how he might
contrive to wear his Sunday clothes on the morrow that
Billy fell asleep to dream that he was old man Scroggie's
ghost and that he was sitting in the centre of Lake Erie
with the big hardwoods bush on his knees, waiting for <i>her</i>
to come that he might present it all to her.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII
<br /><br />
THE DREAD DAY DAWNS
</h3>

<p>
It was broad daylight when Anson, in response to an
angry call from the bottom of the stairway, sat up in bed.
Vaguely he realized that in some dire way this glad
morning proclaimed a day of doom, but his drowsy senses were
still leaping vast chasms of dreamland&mdash;striving to slip
from the control of saner reasoning and drift away with
a happy abandon of dire results to follow.  What boy has
not had the same experience, even although he knew that
a razor-strop, wielded by a vigorous hand, would in all
probability accomplish quickly what his drowsy will had
failed to accomplish?  Anson was just dropping off into
the lulling arms of Morpheus when that extra sense,
possessed by all boys in a measure and by certain boys in
particular, warned him back to wakefulness and a
realization of his danger.
</p>

<p>
He was out of bed and pulling his braces over his shoulders
by the time the heavy footsteps of his mother sounded
at the top of the stairs.
</p>

<p>
"You, Anse!" came Mrs. Wilson's voice.  "Have I
gotta limber you up with the strap, after all?"
</p>

<p>
"Comin', Ma," responded Anse, sleepily.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you'd best come quick, then.  You'll be gettin'
enough hidin's today&mdash;if that new teacher's any
good&mdash;without me havin' to wear my arm out on you 'fore
breakfast."
</p>

<p>
Anson stood still, fumbling the buttons.  So that was
it!  School!  He knew it was some awful catastrophe.
Where was Billy?  He glanced across at the other bed.
Billy was not in it.  He went slowly downstairs, washed
himself, and went in to breakfast.  Billy was not there.
His father was just getting up from the table.
</p>

<p>
"Where's Bill?" Anson asked him.
</p>

<p>
"Down feedin' his pets, most likely," answered his
father as he went out.  A moment or two later Billy came
in.  The boys seated themselves in their places and ate
their breakfast in silence.
</p>

<p>
"Is our dinner up, Ma?" Billy asked, as he pushed
back his chair.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson nodded.  "It is.  Two pieces of bread an'
butter an' a doughnut an' a tart fer each of you.  Is it
enough?"
</p>

<p>
"I guess so," Billy replied indifferently.
</p>

<p>
Anson eyed him suspiciously, then turned to his mother.
"I wish't you'd do our dinners up separate, Ma," he
whined.
</p>

<p>
"Why?" asked Mrs. Wilson, in surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Well, 'cause Bill hogs it, that's why," complained
Anson.  "Last time we had tarts I didn't get none.  An'
it's the same with pie an' cake."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson gazed sternly at Billy.  "Willium, do you
take Anson's tarts and pie?" she asked ominously.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, ma'am," answered Billy, promptly.
</p>

<p>
"There now!" exulted Anson, glancing triumphantly
at his mother, who sat staring and incredulous at the
unabashed offender.
</p>

<p>
Billy looked gravely down at his accuser, then
apprehensively at his judge.  As no immediate sentence seemed
forthcoming he turned toward the door.
</p>

<p>
"Stop!"  Mrs. Wilson had risen suddenly from her
chair and stood pointing an accusing finger at Billy.
</p>

<p>
"You'll ketch it fer this, an' don't you ferget it," she
stormed, "an' if I ever hear of you gobblin' up Anson's
share o' the lunch ag'in, you young glutton, you'll go to
school fer a month without any lunch a'tall."
</p>

<p>
Billy turned.  "I didn't say I ate Anson's pie an' cake,
Ma," he said gently.  "I didn't take it 'cause I wanted it."
</p>

<p>
"Then why did you take it a'tall, I want'a know?"
</p>

<p>
"I took it 'cause I thought it was bad fer him.  You
see, Ma, Anse suffers turrible from indigestion," Billy
explained.  "'Course maybe you don't notice it same as
I do, 'cause you don't sleep in the same room with him.
But Ma, he groans an' gasps all night&mdash;an' he has the
most awful dreams&mdash;now don't you Anse?" he asked,
turning to his brother.
</p>

<p>
Anson started to whimper.  "I do have bad dreams,"
he confessed miserably, "but pie an' tarts ain't to blame
fer it."
</p>

<p>
"Silence, you!"  Mrs. Wilson reached for the dinner-pail
and proceeded to extract from it one tart, one doughnut.
"I guess maybe your brother's right," she said
grimly.  "If that's the way you carry on nights we'll hold
you off pastry fer a while.  Now then, grab that pail and
off to school with both o' you!"
</p>

<p>
Billy was outside first and waiting for Anson at the road
gate when he came down the path, dejectedly wiping his
eyes and vowing inaudible threats at the agent of his
new woe.
</p>

<p>
"Now, then," said Billy as he came up, "maybe you'll
begin to see that it don't pay to blab so danged much."
</p>

<p>
"It was dirty mean of you," sniffled Anson.  "You
know how much I like pie an' tarts; an' here I am havin'
to lug yourn an' gettin' none fer myself.  Fer two cents
I'd chuck this dinner-pail in the crick."
</p>

<p>
"An' fer two cents I'd punch that crooked eye of yourn
straight," cried Billy, his temper rising.  "You'd best
close your mouth while the closin's good, an' if anythin'
happens to that pail you're goin' to hear from me."
</p>

<p>
They passed on in silence until the hardwood grove came
in sight.  Here Billy paused.  "You go on, Anse," he
said.  "I'm goin' over to the menagerie fer a look over
things.  An' see here."  He grabbed his brother's shoulder
and swung him about.  "I'm goin' to tell you something
an' if you so much as peep it to Ma I'm goin' to pass the
word to Ringdo an Croaker that they're free to do what
they like to you; see?"
</p>

<p>
Anson shuddered.  "Aw, who's goin' to peep?' he
returned.
</p>

<p>
"All right then.  Now listen.  This mornin' I tied my
Sunday clothes up an' throwed 'em out our winder.  Then
I got up an' sneaked 'em over to the menagerie.  I'm goin'
to wear 'em to school.  Never you mind why, it's none of
your business.  When I blow into school this mornin'
dressed to kill I don't want you to look too darned
surprised, that's all.  Now if you'll keep your mouth shut
tight about that I promise not to let my witch-coon an'
witch-crow eat you while you sleep; an' I'll tell you what
else I'll do, I'll give you my tart an' my doughnut.  Is it
a bargain?"
</p>

<p>
Anson nodded eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"All hunky.  Now you move along, an' if you happen
to meet Fatty Watland, er Maurice, er any other boys,
don't you let on a word about this."
</p>

<p>
"I won't," promised Anson.  "Cross my heart, Bill."
</p>

<p>
Billy ducked into the path through the grove and Anson
resumed his reluctant pace toward the Valley School.  On
the bridge across Levee creek he came up with Elgin
Scraff.  Elgin was standing with his arms on the bridge
rail, looking dejectedly down into the water.
</p>

<p>
"Hello," Anson accosted.  "Goin' to school?"
</p>

<p>
Elgin lifted his head slowly.  "Yep, you?"
</p>

<p>
Anson nodded and set the dinner-pail down on the
bridge.
</p>

<p>
"Where's Bill?"
</p>

<p>
"He'll be along soon.  Here he comes now; no 'taint
neither, it's Fatty Watland.  Wonder where he's been up
that way?"
</p>

<p>
Watland came puffing up, his round face red and
perspiring.  "Gee!" he panted, "I've been all the way to
the store.  Had to get some sulphur fer Ma.  She found
a wood-tick that old Sport scratched off him on the floor,
an' she swears it's a bed-bug; an' now she's goin' to burn
this sulphur in all the rooms."
</p>

<p>
A grin rippled across his face and grew into a chuckle.
"I bet I sleep in the barn fer a week.  I sure hate the
smell of sulphur."
</p>

<p>
"Come on," said Elgin, "let's move on down to the
sehoolhouse."  Side by side the three passed on up the hill
and down into the valley.
</p>

<p>
The sehoolhouse stood with a wide sloping green before
it and a tangle of second growth forest behind it.  It was
not an old building, but had the appearance of senile old
age.  Its coat of cheap terra-cotta paint had cracked into
many wrinkles; its windows looked dully out like the
lustreless eyes of an old, old man.  The ante-room roof had
been blown off by a winter's gale and replaced inaccurately,
so that it set awry, jaunty and defiant, challenging
the world.  Its door hung on one hinge, leaning sleepily
against a knife-scarred wall.  A rail fence ran about the
yard which was filled to choking with a rank growth of
smart-weed.  In one corner of the yard was a well with a
faded blue pump holding the faded red arm of a handle
toward the skies, as though evoking high heaven to bear
witness that it was never intended to lead such a lonely
and useless existence.
</p>

<p>
The boys approached the building slowly and as they
neared its sombre portals silence fell upon them.  They
opened the creaking gate and entered the building much
after the manner of heroes who must stand blindfolded
against a wall and wait the word "Fire!"  They had to
go through with it, that was all.
</p>

<p>
The building held all the unmistakable odors of a school
room.  The smell of chalk dust, mouldy bread crusts, mice,
dirty slates and musty books rose up to smite the arrivals.
Four rows of pine seats, blackened with ink-daubs and
deeply scarred by pocket-knives, ran the entire length of
the building.  A big box stove stood in the centre of the
room, its wavering pipe supported by wires from the
ceiling.
</p>

<p>
Walter Watland looked about for a good place in which
to conceal his package of sulphur and decided that in the
empty stove he had discovered the place of all places.  So,
while Anson and Elgin were investigating the teacher's
desk and picking out their seats, he proceeded to hide his
sulphur in the stove's black depths.  Then he went outside
with his companions to await the coming of the new
teacher.
</p>

<p>
Scarcely had the three seated themselves on the top rail
of the yard fence than from all directions other pupils of
the Settlement began to arrive.  Sand Sharkers, sullen and
defiant, holding themselves apart, came in one big group.
</p>

<p>
Jim Scroggie entered the school yard with his sister by
his side.  He paused a moment to let his eyes stray to the
faces of the three hopefuls on the fence, conjecturing with
a boy's intuition that in this trio he saw some of the
ring-leaders of the school.  Jim wore a smart tweed coat and
knickerbockers, and a shirt of grey flannel with a soft
silk tie.  His sister, Lou, was dressed daintily in white,
with soft blue collar that matched the glorious depths of
her eyes.  She smiled now, and the three on the fence
immediately underwent a change of heart.  Elgin Scraff
was the first to slide down and approach the new boy in
a spirit of fellowship.
</p>

<p>
"Hello," he said genially.  "I've got a crackin' good
seat.  You kin set with me if you like."
</p>

<p>
Jim shook his head.  "Promised Billy Wilson I'd sit
with him," he said.  "Kin you tell me where he's goin'
to sit?"
</p>

<p>
Elgin was about to answer when he caught a gasp from
the watchers on the road.  "Teacher's comin'!" went
forth the cry.
</p>

<p>
Down the hill came a thin, rangy bay horse, astride
which, an open book in his hand, sat Mr. G. G. Johnston.
As he drew up in front of the gate he closed the book and
turned his frowning eyes on the building.  Utterly
ignoring the awed, watching faces he shook his head grimly
and, looking to neither right nor left, rode in through
the open gate.  Not until he had unbridled his horse
and turned him loose to seek a breakfast as best he knew
how, while he investigated the school's interior, did the
boys and girls outside give way to their feelings.
</p>

<p>
Then Maurice Keeler whistled.  "Whew!  Ain't he the
old human icicle?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"You bet!" came the spontaneous answer.
</p>

<p>
"Gosh," cried Elgin Scraff, "there goes the bell!
Come on everybody; let's get our medicine."
</p>

<p>
Just as the boys and girls were settling down in their
seats and Jim Scroggie was glancing anxiously doorward
Billy strode in.  He was resplendent in his Sunday best
and wore a wild thorn blossom in his button hole.  He
glanced quickly about the room and caught the glint and
sunlight for which he hungered&mdash;a smile from the lips
of Lou Scroggie.  Then he seized Jack LaRose by the
scruff of the neck, jerked him from the seat near the door
and motioned Jim Scroggie over.  "We'll set here," he
whispered.  "It's close to the outside in case we have to
make a quick get-away."
</p>

<p>
The new teacher paid no attention to the little scrimmage
between LaRose and Billy.  He stood on the platform,
tall, spare, hard-featured and stern, and let his
black eyes bore into the souls of the pupils, one after the
other.  Not until the silence of suspense was almost
unbearable did he speak; then clearing his throat he gave
forth in stern tones the following edict:
</p>

<p>
"Boys and girls, I am your teacher.  I shall expect you
to obey me implicitly.  If you do not, I shall punish you.
I am here to teach you; you are here to learn and profit
from my teaching.  I have heard bad reports of most of
you, but for the present I shall refrain from mentioning
any names.  When in the school-room you will be allowed
to address me as 'Sir.'  Outside the school-room you will
not address me in any manner whatsoever."
</p>

<p>
He paused to survey the rows of uplifted faces and let
his words sink home.  Then lifting a long hickory pointer
from his desk, and holding it much as a conjuror might
hold his wand, he gripped the edge of the desk with one
bony hand and leaning forward, said:
</p>

<p>
"Boys and girls, from what has been told me I surmise
that my predecessor has spoiled you.  I do not censure him;
undoubtedly he worked according to his lights.  I have
been twenty years a teacher.  I am your superior in
strength, wisdom and intellect; and this I want you always
to keep in mind.  I shall tolerate neither familiarity nor
disobedience.  You will do well to obey me without question
and do, worthily, the tasks I set for you.  I believe in
administering punishment to wrong-doers, severe punishment.
It is not my purpose to deceive either you or the
ratepayers of this school; therefore, I will admit that I
like neither this district nor its people.  That, however,
will not prevent me from fulfilling my duty to the best of
my ability."
</p>

<p>
He ceased speaking and drew himself up slowly, pursing
his stern lips.  "That is all I have to say for the time
being," he said.  "We shall endeavor to air this building,
after which we will form classes.  Will the fat boy with
the rumpled hair and dirty neck, the one who is whispering
to the boy behind him, be good enough to step forward?"
</p>

<p>
All eyes switched from the teacher to Fatty Watland.
Fatty, his face very red, rose slowly and stood before the
frowning Mr. Johnston.
</p>

<p>
"What is your name, boy?" asked the teacher.
</p>

<p>
"Walter Watland."
</p>

<p>
"Walter Watland&mdash;what?"
</p>

<p>
"That's all.  Jest Walter Watland."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Johnston frowned darkly.  "Walter Watland&mdash;what?"
he repeated.
</p>

<p>
"Sir," prompted a voice from the back seat.
</p>

<p>
"Walter Watland, sir," panted Fatty, glimpsing the
light in the nick of time.
</p>

<p>
"Very well, Walter, you may go home and get a pail
of water.  My experience with school wells," glancing out
of the window to the blue pump, "has been that during
the holidays they become a veritable death trap for frogs,
mice and other vermin."
</p>

<p>
Walter moved quickly to execute the order.  Mr. Johnston
addressed the rest of the pupils.  "School is now
dismissed until we raise the windows and air the room."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII
<br /><br />
THE METTLE OF THE BREED
</h3>

<p>
Immediately thirty boys and girls leaped to their feet
and windows went up with a bang.
</p>

<p>
"I think," Mr. Johnson's voice was heard above the din,
"it would be a good plan to start a fire in that big stove.
This place is positively vault like with dampness."
</p>

<p>
A number of the boys ran out to gather kindling and
wood and soon a fire was crackling in the stove.
</p>

<p>
"Pupils will now take their seats," commanded the
teacher, tinkling the bell on his desk.  There was a hurried
scramble as each boy and girl found his and her place.
</p>

<p>
"We will now have&mdash;" resumed the teacher, then
paused to glare angrily at the stove.  From every crack in
its rusty sides was pouring forth a whitish-yellow smoke
that gripped the throat and smelled like a breath from the
very pit of darkness.  Mr. Johnston attempted to proceed
and failed dismally.  He was choking, as was every boy
and girl in the room.
</p>

<p>
It was Billy Wilson who acted promptly.  Running to
the stove he opened the door and lifted out the blazing
wood and, at the risk of scorching himself badly, ran with
it from the room.
</p>

<p>
It was nearly half an hour before Mr. Johnston summoned
the boys and girls from the open windows to their
seats.  The room still smelled strongly of sulphur, but one
might still breathe and live.
</p>

<p>
In the interval of waiting for the air to clear the new
teacher's face had turned a ghastly white.  His black eyes
blazed; his thin lips were drawn back from his strong,
irregular teeth.  Gazing upon him, the boys and girls
quaked in apprehension.  Their fears were well founded.
Never before in all his long career in administering
knowledge to grubby and inferior minds had Mr. G. G. Johnston
been subject to such deadly insult as had been offered him
here.  It was fully a minute before he could command his
voice sufficiently to speak and when he did the words
trickled through his stiff lips thinly.
</p>

<p>
"Boys and girls," he said at length, "one or more of
you have been guilty of the most unpardonable
misdemeanor that has ever come under my observation as a
teacher.  I realize that the dirty trick has been deliberately
planned, the motive being perhaps to test me.  You may
believe me when I inform you that the one who placed that
sulphur in the stove will have plenty of reason to regret
having done it.  I intend to flog him&mdash;or her&mdash;until he&mdash;or
she&mdash;cannot stand.  I shall now ask the one who is
guilty of the offense to stand up."
</p>

<p>
Nobody stood.  Anson was on the point of jumping to
his feet and telling who had brought the sulphur into the
room but, on second thought, sat still.  The teacher had
asked who had put it in the stove.  Certainly it had not
been Fatty Watland, because he had gone on an errand
for the teacher long before the fire was started.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Johnston smiled darkly and nodded.  "As I thought.
The one who did it is too much of a coward to confess it,"
he grated, his voice shaking.  "Well, there remains but
one thing to do.  If the guilty party is to be punished, I
must punish you one and all."
</p>

<p>
There was the sound of the quick intaking of breath,
and an audible long-drawn "Oh!" from the girls.
</p>

<p>
"I must punish each and every one of you," Mr. Johnston
reiterated, picking up the pointer.  "I shall begin
on the boy who is smiling so defiantly in the back seat, if
he will be good enough to step up here."
</p>

<p>
"I guess that's me," said Billy, jumping to his feet and
starting for the platform.
</p>

<p>
"That's a nice smile you wear," said Mr. Johnston
scathingly as he gazed down at Billy, his bony fingers
caressing the long, supple pointer.
</p>

<p>
"Glad you like it," said Billy.
</p>

<p>
"Eh?  What's that?"  Mr. Johnston fairly recoiled in
surprise and indignation at the affront to his dignity.
"Silence! boys and girls," he shouted, as a titter ran
through the schoolroom.
</p>

<p>
"Now young man," he said grimly, grasping one of
Billy's hands and pulling it forward and out, "I'm going
to drive that happy smile from your face."
</p>

<p>
"You're a'goin' to find that some job," said Billy
quietly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, we'll see, young Mr. Impudence."  The long
pointer rose and fell.  Billy caught the stroke full on his
palm.  His face whitened with pain, but the smile did not
leave his lips.
</p>

<p>
"Your other hand," commanded Mr. Johnston.
</p>

<p>
He bent forward to grasp the hand which Billy raised
slowly, thereby dodging a stone ink-bottle hurled by
Maurice Keeler.  At it was the bottle struck the blackboard
and broke, deluging the teacher's face with a sable spray.
</p>

<p>
Billy turned quickly.  "No more of that," he said.
"This is my funeral&mdash;and the teacher's.  Everybody else
keep out of it."
</p>

<p>
He squared his shoulders and held out his hand.  The
pointer came down with all the strength that the man dared
put behind it.  Johnston peered closely into the boy's face.
It was white and quivering but it still wore a smile.
</p>

<p>
"Take your seat," commanded the teacher.  "Next boy
forward!"  One by one the boys walked up to receive
their punishment.  All took it bravely.
</p>

<p>
When, at last, the boys had all been attended to,
Mr. Johnston paused for rest.  "I shall now begin on the
girls," he said, "but before administering punishment
I am going to give the guilty boy, or girl, one more chance
to confess.  Will the one who put the sulphur in the stove
stand up?"
</p>

<p>
As before, nobody moved.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Johnston smiled.  "Very well.  The girl with the
handkerchief to her eyes, the one dressed in white and
blue, five seats down, will come forward for punishment."
</p>

<p>
Billy felt his blood run cold.  He could not believe his
ears.  The girl dressed in white and blue!  Why, that was
she&mdash;his angel&mdash;his light&mdash;his everything.  And she was
crying now.  She was standing up, moving forward.
</p>

<p>
Like a flash Billy was on his feet.  "Stop!" he cried,
his voice ringing out like a challenge.  "You don't whip
her if I know it."
</p>

<p>
For the second time that morning Mr. Johnston received
a violent shock to his dignity.  Such rank insubordination
he had never experienced before.  The black eyes turned
on Billy fairly darting sparks.  "Take your seat, you
impudent boy!" he thundered, "I see I have been too
lenient with you.  When I am through with the girls I
shall flog you until you cry for mercy, and with you the
boy who threw that bottle."
</p>

<p>
Billy was running up the aisle.
</p>

<p>
"Please sir, don't whip her," he said, pleadingly.  "I'll
own up.  It was me that put the sulphur in the stove."
</p>

<p>
"You?" gasped Mr. Johnston.  "You coward! to let
your companions be punished for your despicable act.
Oh," he exulted, removing his coat and rolling up his
sleeves, "won't I make you pay for playing the sneak?"
</p>

<p>
Billy was giving no attention to the teacher.  He was
edging towards Lou Scroggie, who stood looking at him
from dumb, pleading eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Go outside," he whispered.  "Please do; I kin stand
anythin', but I don't want you to see it."
</p>

<p>
She turned slowly away, then came back and put her
hands on his shoulders.  She did not speak but the look
she gave him was enough.  His heart laughed.  He turned
toward the teacher with so glad a light in his grey eyes
that the schooled moulder of young souls gazed back at
him in bewilderment.
</p>

<p>
Was this the brand of boy this Shagland Settlement
bred, he wondered.  If so, God help him and his precepts.
</p>

<p>
From the bottom of his heart he wished that he had never
seen the place, never encountered the spirit of its
woods-born.  He knew his capabilities and for once in his life,
he confessed to himself, he had over-estimated them.  He
wanted to give this boy now standing so fearlessly before
him a whipping such as he would remember to his dying
day, but to save his life he couldn't enter into the task
with his old-time zest&mdash;not with those clear eyes looking
so contemptuously into his very soul.
</p>

<p>
The room had grown still&mdash;a graveyard hush, broken
only by a sob from the tenderest-hearted of the girls, who
knew that Billy had lied to save one of their sex.
</p>

<p>
Johnston had turned to his desk and secured a shorter,
stronger pointer.  The veins between his shaggy eyebrows
stood out clearly defined as he motioned Billy up on the
platform.
</p>

<p>
It was just at this juncture that Fatty Watland arrived;
smiling and panting, with the pail, borrowed from his
mother, full of drinking water.  It took him but a moment
to learn from one of the boys what had transpired.  It
took him still less time to reach the platform.  There, with
much humiliation of spirit and many "sirs," he explained
to the greatly surprised, and it must be confessed, secretly
relieved Mr. Johnston, the true state of affairs.
</p>

<p>
There was no doubt in the world that Fatty regretted
the part he had so unwittingly played in the day's disaster.
He was sufficiently apologetic and low spirited to satisfy
even the new teacher, who was content to let him off with
a lecture.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Johnston then briefly stated to his pupils that a
mistake had been made.  He did not say that he was sorry.
That would have been an untruth.  He did say that Billy
deserved another whipping for lying, but under the
circumstances he would excuse him, as he had already received
unmerited punishment.
</p>

<p>
At the close of his first day in the Valley School
Mr. Johnston was forced to confess that he had considerable
work before him.  Had he been able to read the future and
learn just what he would be obliged to undergo as teacher
of that school, without doubt he would have climbed on
the back of his thin horse and ridden straight away from
Scotia Settlement, never to return.  But he could not read
what the future held, consequently he rode slowly towards
Fairfield that first evening with the righteous feeling of
one who had performed a difficult task well and
satisfactorily&mdash;at least to himself.
</p>

<p>
Back in the schoolyard a real old fashioned indignation
meeting was being held by thirty lusty boys and girls.
That any man, teacher or no teacher, should come into
their beloved Settlement and announce that he had no use
for it or its people and go on his way unscathed was beyond
all understanding.  Something would have to be done about
it; but what?  It was Billy who climbed up on the school
fence, called order and offered the one sure solution to the
problem.
</p>

<p>
"I guess we don't want'a keep him, do we?" he asked
of his companions.
</p>

<p>
"No.  No!" came in chorus.
</p>

<p>
"All right; that's settled.  But listen, now, every one of
you.  He's gotta go of his own accord.  We're not goin'
to be disobedient in any way.  Fer a time we'll eat out'a
his hand.  Now wait&mdash;" as a groan of protest went up&mdash;"let
me finish afore you get the high-jumps, you fellers.
At the end of two er three weeks somethin' is goin' to
happen to Mr. Johnston.  I'm not goin' to say what that
somethin' is right now, but you'll all know soon enough.
And if after it happens he's got nerve enough to come back
here I miss my guess, that's all."
</p>

<p>
"Hurrah!" shouted the delighted boys.  "We knowed
you'd find a way to fix him, Billy."
</p>

<p>
Billy climbed down from the fence and his supporters
gathered about him, eager to secure the details of his plan
but he shook his head.  "You kin jest leave it all to me,
an' one er two others I'm goin' to pick to help me," he
said.  "It's soon enough fer you to know how we do it
when it's done.  Now, everybody go home."
</p>

<p>
Apparently quite by accident he found himself standing
beside Lou Scroggie and the two fell into step together.
They were the last to take the winding path toward the
main road.  An embarrassed silence fell between them, a
silence which remained unbroken until they reached the
creek bridge.  Then the girl said shyly: "Do you mind
if I call you Billy?"
</p>

<p>
Billy had to stifle his emotion and swallow twice before
he answered: "That's what I'd like you to call me.  I'll
bet you can't say it, though."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I can so!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, let's hear you, then."
</p>

<p>
He bent his head and held his breath, oblivious to
everything save the ecstasy of that moment.
</p>

<p>
"Billy," she half-whispered, then hiding her flushed
face in her hands she turned and ran from him.
</p>

<p>
Billy did not follow.  Something, perhaps the primitive
man in him, cautioned the unwisdom of so doing.  From
the dim, far-back ages woman has run and man has
pursued.  But a few wise men have waited.
</p>

<p>
So Billy watched her passing like a ray of soft light
across the valley and around the golden curve of the road.
Then with his arms on the bridge-rail, his eyes gazing deep
into the amber depths of the water, he lived anew every
moment of her nearness, until the hoarse, joyful cry of a
crow broke in on his reverie.  Croaker, having grown
lonely, had come down to meet him.
</p>

<p>
So with the bird perched on his shoulders, muttering a
strange jargon of endearments and throaty chuckles in his
ear, Billy turned up the path, thinking still of a pair of
blue eyes and a voice that had called him "Billy."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX
<br /><br />
CROAKER BRINGS A GIFT
</h3>

<p>
It was Sunday.  Anson, with eyes close-shut and suds
dripping from his freckled nose, was having his weekly
ear and neck cleansing, his mother's strong hands applying
the coarse wash-cloth.  Billy stood by, anticipating his
turn, his eyes straying occasionally to the long
"muzzle-loader" hanging on the deer-prong rack.  Tomorrow the
duck-season opened and he was wondering how he was
going to contrive to sneak the old gun down and give it a
thorough cleaning.  Suddenly he became aware that
operations in the vicinity of the wash-basin had become
suspended.  He glanced across to find his mother's gaze fixed
sternly upon him.  Anson was looking mightily pleased.
</p>

<p>
"I want'a know how you got them ink blots on your good
clothes.  Have you been a'wearin' 'em to school?" asked
Mrs. Wilson.
</p>

<p>
So that was it?  Anson had "peached"!  Billy swallowed
hard.  His mind reviewed the days of the past two
weeks.  Again he saw a pair of blue eyes, misty with love
and feeling; heard a voice whose cadence was sweeter than
honey saying, "My!  Billy, you are so different from any
other boy I've ever met; and you always wear such nice
clothes, too."  Oh those wonderful, joy-filled days!  What
boy would not have risked far more than he had risked to
win such commendation from the girl of all girls.
</p>

<p>
"Well?"  His mother's voice dispelled the vision.  "Are
you goin' to answer me, Willium?"
</p>

<p>
Billy squared his shoulders.  Yes, he would do as she
would wish.  He would confess.  But the best of intentions
go oft awry and Billy's present ones were suddenly
sidetracked by a giggle from Anson, a giggle freighted with
malice, triumph and devilish joy at his predicament.
</p>

<p>
Now, a boy may make up his mind to die a hero, but no
boy cares to be ushered out by gibes and "I-told-you-so's."  Billy
promptly adopted new tactics.  "This ain't my suit,
Ma," he said.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson started so at his words that she rammed
the cake of soap into Anson's mouth.
</p>

<p>
"Not yourn?  Then whose is it?" she cried in amazement.
</p>

<p>
"It's Anse's.  We must have got 'em mixed when we
was dressin'."
</p>

<p>
"Willium, are you lyin' to me?  If you are it's goin'
to be the costliest lie you ever told."
</p>

<p>
Billy returned her angry gaze without a flicker of an
eyelid.  The reproach in his grey eyes was enough to make
any mother ashamed of having doubted, and, as a matter
of natural consequence, anger her the more.  "How do
you know that's Anson's suit?" she shot at Billy, between
rubs.  "How do you know it, you young imp, you?"
</p>

<p>
Billy moved forward, halting a safe distance from his
mother.  "You'll remember, Ma, that Anse's pants has
two hip pockets, an mine only one."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, that's so."
</p>

<p>
"An' his coat has two inside pockets, an' mine only one."
</p>

<p>
"I remember that, too.  Well?"
</p>

<p>
Billy removed the coat he was wearing and passed it
over to his mother.  She turned it inside out, and inspected
it closely.
</p>

<p>
"That's Anson's coat all right," she affirmed.  "Now
twist about so's I kin see them hip pockets in the pants."
</p>

<p>
Billy did so.  Then, there being nothing more left to do,
he stepped back to watch the fireworks.
</p>

<p>
Stunned into inaction by the ease and suddenness with
which Billy had turned the tables against him Anson had
only time to take one longing glance toward the door.
His mother had lifted the razor-strop from its nail and as
he made a frenzied leap toward safety her strong hand
gripped him by the wet hair.  "Swish" fell the strop
and Anson's wail of woe rent the Sabbath air.  In vain he
squirmed, cried, protested his innocence.
</p>

<p>
Having gotten nicely warmed up to her work Mrs. Wilson
turned a deaf ear to his wails.  "You would try to
put off your dirty tracks on your brother, would you?"
Swish-swish.  "I'll teach you to wear your good clothes
to school.  I'll teach you to lie to me, you bad, deceitful,
ungrateful boy, you!
</p>

<p>
"Now," she panted, having reached the limit of her
strength, "you go upstairs with Willium and change
clothes.  Not another word, er I'll start in on you all over
ag'in.  Off you go, both o'you.  And Willium," she called
after them, "when you get into your own suit, don't
you ferget to come here fer your scrubbin'."
</p>

<p>
When Billy reached the loft, Anson was standing in the
center of the room, smashing with clenched fists at the
empty air.  Billy sat down on his bed and grinned.  "You
will run straight into trouble, in spite of all I say, Anse,"
he said gently.  "It's all your own fault; you will be a
tattle-tale."
</p>

<p>
Anson turned on him.  "You mean sneak!" he gasped,
"you've been wearin' my Sunday clothes 'stead of your
own, an' I didn't know it."
</p>

<p>
Billy nodded.  "You see, Anse, I knowed that sooner
or later you was bound to tell Ma, so I played safe, that's
all."
</p>

<p>
Anson, still sniffling, finished his undressing.  Billy
nursed his knee in his hands and watched him.  "'Course,"
he remarked, at length, "you'll be for tellin' Ma soon's
she calms down a bit an' is ready to listen, but Anse I
wouldn't do it if I was you."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you kin bet I jest will do it," promised Anson.
</p>

<p>
Billy stood up.  "I'll tell you what I'm willin' to do,
Anse," he suggested.  "If you'll keep mum about this
thing, I'll let you come duck-shootin' with me an' Maurice
tomorrow."
</p>

<p>
Anson shook his head.  "I don't want'a go duck-shootin',"
he said.  "I know jest what you fellers 'ud do;
you'd get me in all the bog-holes an' make me carry your
ducks.  No sir, I'm goin' to tell Ma."
</p>

<p>
Billy tried further inducements.  "I'll give you my new
red tie an' celluloid collar," he offered.
</p>

<p>
"No!"
</p>

<p>
"Then," said Billy sorrowfully, turning toward the
door, "I guess there's only one thing fer me to do."
</p>

<p>
"An' what's that?" asked Anse, apprehensively.
</p>

<p>
"Go an' tell Croaker an' Ringdo the whole business, an'
let that crow an' swamp-coon 'tend to you."
</p>

<p>
"Hold on, Bill, wait a minute," Anson quavered.
"I've changed my mind, I'll take the tie an' collar an'
call it square."
</p>

<p>
Billy turned and came back slowly to where he sat.
"Anse," he said.  "I ain't wantin' to see you witch-chased,
so I'll jest give you the tie an' collar an' say not
a word to Croaker er Ringdo; an' if you'll tell me
somethin' I want'a know I'll let you sleep with my rabbit-foot
charm underneath your piller."
</p>

<p>
Anson almost sobbed his relief.  "I'll do it," he agreed.
"What is it you want'a know, Bill?"
</p>

<p>
"I want'a know all you know about them men that are
workin' Hinter's borin' outfit.  Why ain't they ever seen
outside that tall fence Scroggie's built 'round the derrick,
an' why did he build that fence, anyways?"
</p>

<p>
Anson looked troubled.  "Supposin' I don't know&mdash;"
he began, but Billy shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"I happen to know you do know.  'Course you needn't
tell, if you don't want to," he said.  "You kin keep what
you know to yourself an' take your chances with witches.
I was jest givin' you a last chance, that's all."
</p>

<p>
He turned once more to the door but Anson jumped up
and caught him by the arm.  "Bill," he gasped.  "I
don't know why Hinter built that fence, cross my heart, I
don't.  But I'll tell you all I know about the men who're
runnin' the rig.  I been workin' fer the tool-dresser after
school, fer a quarter a night.  I've heard quite a lot o'
talk among them fellers.  Blamed if I could make head er
tail of most of it but they mentioned a feller by the name
of Jacobs an' they seem plumb scared to death of him.
Funny, too, 'cause he's never been 'round there a'tall.
Nobody ever comes there but Hinter."
</p>

<p>
"How do you mean they seem scared of Jacobs?"
</p>

<p>
"I kin tell by what they say.  One night I heard the
big feller, named Tom, say to Jack, the other man: 'If
we don't strike the stuff Jacobs is done fer, an' both of us'll
go with him.'  An' the one named Jack he swore at him
an' says: 'Shut your trap, Tom.  One of these days Jacobs
is goin' to hear you blattin'; then you're goin' to take a
trip sooner than you expected.'"
</p>

<p>
Billy stood frowning.  "Say, maybe Jacobs is the feller
that fires the boilers that runs the windlass," he hazarded.
</p>

<p>
"Nope, that man's name's Sanderson.  He don't have
anythin' to do with the drillers.  Nope, Bill, Jacobs hain't
never been seen, but I'm dead sure he's the boss of the
outfit."
</p>

<p>
"All right, Anse.  You kin learn a lot more by keepin'
your ears an' eyes open.  Whatever you see an' hear, you're
to tell me, see?"
</p>

<p>
Anson nodded.
</p>

<p>
"All hunky.  Now, I'll jest peel off these duds, an'
get inter my own.  Ma'll be gettin' uneasy."
</p>

<p>
But when Billy, dressed in his own suit, descended the
stairs to peer cautiously out, it was to find the room
deserted.  Mrs. Wilson's voice, high-pitched and excited,
came from the back yard.
</p>

<p>
"Willium! oh Willium!" she was calling.
</p>

<p>
With a bound he was outside and over beside her.  She
sat on the block beneath the hop-vine, her face in her apron.
She was rocking to and fro and sobbing.
</p>

<p>
"Ma," cried Billy, "whatever is the matter?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh Willium," she cried, "my heart is breakin'.  Oh
to think how I misjedged him!"
</p>

<p>
Billy's eyes opened wide.  "Misjedged him?" he
repeated.
</p>

<p>
"Oh the poor little dear! the poor little dear!" she
wailed.  "Me hatin' him like I did, and him doin' all he
has fer me.  Oh, Willium, I do feel so 'shamed, an' mean;
I do so!"
</p>

<p>
Billy stared at his mother in amazement.  "Jest what
has Anse ever did fer you, Ma?" he asked wonderingly.
</p>

<p>
"Anse!" she snorted.  "Who's talkin' about Anse?
It's Croaker I mean.  Look here what that darlin' crow
brought me jest a few minutes ago."
</p>

<p>
She opened her hand.  In it lay a shining twenty-dollar
gold piece.  Billy's mouth fell open in astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"Croaker brought you that?" he gasped.  "Well, I'll
be shot!"  Billy stood up and gazed about him.  "Where's
Croaker now?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"I dunno.  He jest laughed an' sailed away ag'in.  I
don't know where he got it but I do know good gold when
I see it, Willium.  Twenty dollars!  Ain't it splendid?"
</p>

<p>
"It sure is, but I can't help wonderin' where Croaker
found it.  Maybe you wouldn't mind lettin' me off Sunday
School today, Ma," he suggested, "so's I kin trail off an'
find that Croaker.  Any crow that kin pick up gold pieces
that way is worth watchin'.  Kin I go look fer him, Ma?"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson, at this particular moment, was in the mood
to grant almost any request.  "Why Willium," she said
eagerly, "go seek him and bring him back home.  Never
ag'in will I wish him dead, poor little feller.  But," she
added as though realizing that her softened mood had
carried her a little too far, "you see you get back here in
time for supper er I'm liable to tan you good."
</p>

<p>
Billy waited for no more.  He was up and away like a
shot.  Mrs. Wilson, clutching her gold piece in one hand
and brushing back her deranged hair with the other, went
back into the house.
</p>

<p>
Anson, striving to keep his head above a shiny collar,
about which was twisted a flaming red tie, was just issuing
from the stairs.  His mother opened her hand to display
her gold piece, then closed it again.  "You go right back
upstairs and take off Willium's collar and tie," she
commanded.
</p>

<p>
"It's my own collar an' tie," Anson declared, "Bill
give it to me."
</p>

<p>
"Humph!  That's jest like him, but why he should give
you his best tie and collar is beyond me.  Do you think
you deserve any gifts from your brother after what you
done to him?  It jest goes to show you what a real good
heart that boy has.  I declare, Anson, I do wish you was
more like him.  Now you get your hair combed and your hat
brushed and get away to Sunday School."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Ma'am; ain't you agoin', Ma?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll be long shortly; don't you wait fer me."
</p>

<p>
"But where's Bill?  Ain't he agoin?"
</p>

<p>
"No, he ain't agoin'; and now, not another of your fool
questions.  Slick your hair down and go at once.  Do you
hear me?"
</p>

<p>
Anson proceeded to obey orders without another word.
As he picked up his hat and turned to the door, Mrs. Wilson
opened her hand and held out the gold piece.
</p>

<p>
"Croaker found that and brought it to me," she said,
proudly.
</p>

<p>
Anson's jaw dropped and he backed fearfully away.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you have nuthin' to do with it, Ma!" he cried.
"That Croaker's a witch crow, that's what he is!  He's
tryin' to tempt you with gold!"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson stood, the picture of amazement.  "Have
you gone stark and ravin' crazy, Anson?" she asked
sternly.  Then, anger mastering her, she reached for the
broom standing in the corner.  Anson promptly made his
escape, but as he passed the open window, he gazed wildly
in at his mother and cried again: "Don't you have nuthin'
to do with that gold, Ma.  If you do we'll all get burnt up
in our beds, er get clawed to tatters!"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson sank down on a chair.  "Willium's right,"
she sighed.  "Anson's mind is gettin' a little unbalanced.
I'll have to put him on diet and feed him slippery-elm
bark and alloways."
</p>

<p>
Sighing dolefully she arose, placed her treasured gold
piece in the clock for safe keeping, and tying on her bonnet,
left the house.  She walked hurriedly down the path,
thinking that perhaps she might be late for the opening
hymn.  As she was about to open the gate, a slender,
sprightly old gentleman, dressed in long frock coat, stepped
out from the trees bordering the road, and gravely lifting
his shiny hat, bowed low, and said: "Your pardon, ma'am,
I'm axin; but if ye'll permit me."
</p>

<p>
"Harry O'Dule," she gasped, as he swung the gate
wide, "is it re'lly you?"
</p>

<p>
"Faith and who else ma'am," replied Harry.  "The
ould burrud wid new feathers is ut.  Faith ut's manny a
year since I laid these duds carefully by, thinkin' I'd be
wearin' 'em niver ag'in until a day whin I'd not be
knowin' ut.  But, Mistress Wilson, ma'am, ut's other
thoughts have been mine since I quit the dhrink.  Pl'ase
God but duty is iver clearer wid clearer understandin' and
so ut is.  Some day afore I die I'll glimpse me own skies
and smell the burnin' peat, and if that is to be mine thin
must I live me life clane here and do me duty like an
Irishman av birth.  So, ma'am, it's off I am to visit the holy
Father at Palmyria."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson held out her hand.  "Harry O'Dule," she
said, her voice unsteady, "I always knowed you had the
makin's of a man in you.  I'm gladder than I kin say."
</p>

<p>
Harry bowed low.  Mrs. Wilson passed through the gate,
beaming commendation on him from misty eyes.  He closed
the gate slowly, his clean shaven, wrinkled face working.
He stood and watched her until the bend in the road hid
her.  Then, placing his tall hat jauntily on his grizzled
locks, he turned and walked smartly in the opposite
direction.

<h3>
CHAPTER XX
<br /><br />
BILLY MEETS A LOVELY GHOST
</h3>

<p>
Billy found Croaker just where he thought he would
be&mdash;clinging to the latch of the menagerie door and peering
with one black eye through the chink above it at the owls,
the while he hurled guttural insults at them.
</p>

<p>
"Croaker," commanded his master, "get away from
there!"
</p>

<p>
Croaker balanced himself by flopping one short wing
and laughed at the hisses of the angered owls.  He hopped
from his perch to the peak of the shanty as Billy reached
for him and there he sat, demurely turning his head from
one side to the other and muttering low in his throat.
</p>

<p>
"Croaker, come down here, I want'a ask you
somethin'."  Billy's hand went into his pocket and the crow
stood at attention.  Then as the hand came away empty
he emitted an angry croak and wobbled further along the
ridge-board.
</p>

<p>
"Come, nice old Croaker, tell me where you found the
gold," coaxed Billy.
</p>

<p>
Croaker turned his back and murmured a whole string
of "coro-corrs," which to Billy meant just as plain as
words could say it that he hadn't the slightest intention of
telling anything.
</p>

<p>
"All right then, Croaker, I'll call Ringdo, an' feed him
your dinner."
</p>

<p>
Now, for the swamp-coon, Croaker had all the jealousy
and hatred a crow is capable of feeling and as a last
resort, whenever he was obdurate and disobedient as he
was now, his master could nearly always bring him to
submission by the mere mention of Ringdo's name.  At Billy's
threat Croaker raised his head and poured forth such a
jargon of heart-broken lamentation that the listening owls
inside crouched low in terror, their amber eyes questioning
the meaning of the awful sound.
</p>

<p>
Billy bent and patted an imaginary something on the
ground.  "Good ol' Ringdo," he said.  "Nice ol' Ringdo."  That
was the last straw.  With a croak of anguish Croaker
swooped down and lit on his master's shoulder.  Promptly
five fingers gripped his feet.
</p>

<p>
"Now, you black beggar, I've got you," exulted Billy.
This fact did not seem to worry Croaker in the least.  His
beady eyes were busy searching for signs of his enemy.
Ringdo being nowhere visible, his neck feathers gradually
lowered and his heavy beak closed.  He snuggled close
against Billy's face and told him in throaty murmurs how
much he loved him.  Billy laughed, and seating himself on
a log, placed the crow on his knees.
</p>

<p>
"Croaker," he addressed the bird, "you must'a found
ol' Scroggie's gold.  He had the only gold money this
country ever saw, so you must have found it some way.
I don't s'pose it'll do Teacher Stanhope any good, 'cause
it'll go to Jim Scroggie's father, but, Croaker, it's up to
us to get that money an' turn it over; hear me?"
</p>

<p>
Croaker blinked and seemed to be thinking hard.
</p>

<p>
"You see," Billy went on, "maybe the will'll be where
the gold is.  You be a real good feller an' show me where
you found the gold-piece."
</p>

<p>
"Sure I will," agreed Croaker.  He hopped down and
started pigeon-toeing across the glade, peering back to
see if Billy were coming.
</p>

<p>
Billy followed slowly, hoping, fearing, trusting that
Croaker's intentions were of the best.  The crow was
carrying on a murmured conversation with himself, flapping
his wings, nodding his head sagely and in other ways
manifesting his eagerness to accommodate his master.
When he grew tired of walking he flew and Billy had to
run to keep him in sight.  Straight through the grove,
across the green valley and on through the stumpy fallow
went the crow, Billy panting and perspiring behind.
Straight on to the pine-hedged creek and still on, until the
lonely pine grove of the haunted house came into view.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Jerusalem!" gasped Billy, "An' me without my
rabbit foot charm."  He realized where Croaker was
leading him&mdash;straight to the haunted house.  He wiped his
streaming face on his sleeve and determined he'd go
through with it.
</p>

<p>
Croaker paused for a moment in the edge of the grove
to look back at Billy.  The bird was plainly excited; his
wings were spread, his neck feathers erect, and his raucous
voice was scattering nesting birds from the evergreens in
flocks.
</p>

<p>
With wildly beating heart Billy passed through the pines,
the twilight gloom adding to his feeling of awe.  Croaker
had become strangely silent and now flitted before him
like a black spirit of a crow.  It was almost a relief when
at last the tumble-down shack grew up in its tangle of
vines and weeds.  Once more into the daylight and Croaker
took up the interrupted thread of his conversation with
himself.  He ducked and side-stepped and gave voice to
expressions which Billy had never heard him use before.
</p>

<p>
"I wish he'd shut up," he murmured to himself, "but
I'm scared to make him, fer fear he'll get sulky an' quit
cold on the job."
</p>

<p>
Croaker, mincing in and out among the rag-weeds, led
straight across the yard to a tiny ramshackle building
which at one time might have been a root-house.  Billy,
feeling that at any moment an icy hand might reach out
and grip his windpipe, followed.  It was a terrible risk
he was running but the prize was worth it.  His feet
seemed weighted with lead.  At last he reached the
root-house and leaned against it, dizzy and panting.  Then he
looked about for Croaker.  The crow had vanished!
</p>

<p>
A thrill of alarm gripped Billy's heart-strings.  Where
had Croaker disappeared to?  What if old Scroggie's ghost
had grabbed him and cast over him the cloak of invisibility?
Then in all likelihood he would be the next to feel
that damp, clutching shroud.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly his fears vanished.  Croaker's voice,
high-pitched and jubilant, had summoned him from somewhere
on the other side of the building.  As quickly as the weeds
and his lagging feet would permit Billy joined him.
Croaker was standing erect on a pile of old bottles, basking
in the radiance of the colored lights which the sun drew
from them.  Undoubtedly in his black heart he felt that
his master would glory in this glittering pile even as he
gloried in it; for was there not in this heap of dazzling old
bottles light enough to make the whole world glad?
</p>

<p>
But Billy gazed dully at the treasure with sinking heart
and murmured: "You danged old humbug, you!"  Croaker
was surprised, indignant, hurt.  He reached down
and struck one of the shiniest of the bottles with his beak
but even the happy tinkle that ensued failed to rouse
enthusiasm in his master.
</p>

<p>
"O Croaker," groaned Billy, "why won't you find the
gold fer me?"  Croaker returned his master's look of
reproach with beady, insolent eyes.  "Cawrara-cawrara-cawrara,"
he murmured, backing from the pile, which
meant, "Why don't you carry one of these beautiful
shiny things home for me?  Isn't that what I brought you
here to do?"
</p>

<p>
Then, his master still remaining blind to the wealth of
treasure disclosed to him, Croaker spread his wings and
sailed away over the pine-tops.  Billy, despair in his heart,
followed.  All fear of the supernatural was gone from him
now, crowded out by bitter disappointment at his failure
to find the hidden gold.  He passed close beside the haunted
house without so much as a thought of the ghost of the
man who had owned it and on through the silent pines
and shadowy, grave-yard silence.
</p>

<p>
Then, just as he drew near to the edge of the grove,
he caught his breath in terror and the cold sweat leaped
out on his fear-blanched face.  Drifting directly toward
him white as driven snow, came the ghost.  It was bearing
straight down upon him!  His knees grew weak, refused
to hold him, and he sagged weakly against a tree.  He
closed his eyes and waited for the end.
</p>

<p>
Billy had heard that when one comes face to face with
death the misdeeds of the life about to go out crowd into
one brief second of darting reality before one.  He had
never quite believed it but he believed it now.  If only he
might have his misspent life to live over again!  Never
again would he steal Deacon Ringold's melons or swap
broken-backed, broken-bladed jack-knives for good ones
with the Sand-sharks, nor frighten his brother Anson with
tales of witches and goblins.  But that chance was not for
him.  It was, perhaps, natural that his last earthly thought
would be of her.  Her sweet face shone through the choking
mists&mdash;her trembling lips were murmuring a last "good
bye."  Did she know what a wonderful influence her
entrance into his heart had exerted toward his reform?
With an effort he opened his eyes.  The white, gliding
thing was almost upon him now.  He tried to shake off
frozen terror and run.  He could not move a muscle.  He
groaned and shut his eyes tight, waiting for the icy touch
of a spirit-hand.  It found him after what seemed an
eternity of waiting&mdash;but it was very soft and warm
instead of clammy and cold and the voice which spoke his
name was not in the least sepulchral.
</p>

<p>
"Billy."
</p>

<p>
A long shiver ran through his tense frame.  He opened
his eyes slowly.  <i>She</i> stood before him!  Yes there was no
doubt of it, she was there, blue eyes smiling into his, warm
fingers sending a thrill through his numbed being.
</p>

<p>
He tried to speak, tried to pronounce her name, but the
effort was a failure.  All he could do was to drink in her
perfect loveliness.  More than ever like an angel she looked,
standing all in white in the blue-dark gloom of the grove,
her hair glowing like a halo above the deep pools of her
eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Billy," she spoke again, "are you sick?"
</p>

<p>
With a supreme effort of will he shook off his numbness
and the red flush of shame wiped the pallor from his
cheeks.  What would she think of him if she knew?  The
very anguish of the thought spurred him to play the part
of hypocrite.  It was despicable, he knew, but what man
has not had to play it, sooner or later, in the great game
of love?
</p>

<p>
"Fell out o' a tree," he managed to say.  "Struck my
head on a limb."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" she cried commiseratingly.  She came closer to
him&mdash;so close that her very nearness made him dizzy with
joy.  With a tiny handkerchief she wiped the perspiration
from his forehead.
</p>

<p>
"Come out into the light and let me see where you
hurt yourself," she said, oh so gently.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think it left any mark," Billy stammered.
"Anyways, I feel a whole lot better now.  It was foolish
for me to climb that tall tree.  I didn't have to do it."
</p>

<p>
"Then why did you do it?"  They were out into the
hardwoods by now, in a long valley strewn with a net-work
of sunbeams and shadows and he saw a hint of reproach
in her big eyes as she asked the question.  His heart leaped
with sheer joy.  She might just as well have said, "You
have no right to run risks, now that you have me to
consider."
</p>

<p>
They sat down on a mossy log.  Her fingers brushed
back his hair as her eyes sought vainly for marks or
bruises.
</p>

<p>
"I asked you why you climbed the tree, Billy?"
</p>

<p>
Billy's mind worked with lightning speed.
</p>

<p>
"There was a little cedar bird's nest in a tall pine,"
he explained.  "I saw a crow black bird fly out of it, and
knew she had laid her egg in that nest."
</p>

<p>
"But why should she lay her egg in the cedar bird's
nest; hasn't she a nest of her own?" asked Lou.
</p>

<p>
"No, crow black birds are too lazy to build nests.  They
take the first nest comes handy."
</p>

<p>
She looked her wonder.  "But, Billy, you'd think they
would want to enjoy building their own homes, wouldn't
you?"
</p>

<p>
Billy shook his head.  "The crow black bird don't want
to be bothered with hatchin' an' feedin' her own young.
That's why she lays in other bird's nests," he explained.
"She jest lays her egg an' beats it out o' there.  The other
poor little bird waits for her to go.  Then she goes back
to her nest, glad enough to find it hasn't been torn to bits."
</p>

<p>
"And you mean to tell me that she hatches the egg laid
by the mean, bad black bird, Billy?"
</p>

<p>
"Yep, she does jest that.  She don't seem to know any
better.  Birds an' animals are queer that way.  Why, even
a weasel'll nurse a baby rabbit along with her own kittens
if it's hungry."
</p>

<p>
The girl's eyes grew wider and wider with wonderment.
"Isn't it strange?" she half whispered, "and beautiful?"
</p>

<p>
"It's mighty queer," Billy confessed.  "But you see, if
that little bird was wise, she'd scoop that crow black bird's
egg out o' her nest, instead of hatchin' it."
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
"Because when the egg's hatched, the little black bird
is so much stronger an' bigger than the cedar birdies he
takes most of the feed the old birds bring in.  He starves
the other little birds an' crowds 'em clean out o' the nest."
</p>

<p>
"Then it was brave of you to risk climbing that tall tree
to frighten that crow bird away," declared Lou.  The
admiration and commendation in the blue eyes watching
him was more than Billy could endure.
</p>

<p>
"Say!" he burst out.  "I lied to you, Lou, I didn't fall
out o' no tree, I was jest scared plum stiff when you found
me, that's all."
</p>

<p>
He hung his head and braced himself to meet what was
justly coming to him.  She would despise him now, he
knew.  He felt a gentle touch on his arm, and raised his
face slowly.  The girl's red lips were smiling.  He could
scarcely believe his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad you told me, Billy," she said.  "I&mdash;I hoped
you might."
</p>

<p>
"Then you knowed I was scared?" he cried in wonder.
</p>

<p>
She nodded.  "I suppose I should have called to you,
but I had forgotten what I had heard about this grove
being haunted and that I was dressed all in white.  But
when I came to you and saw your face I knew that you
were frightened."
</p>

<p>
"Frightened!  Oh gollies, I was so scared that I chattered
my teeth loose.  But honest Injun, Lou, I don't scare
easy.  I wouldn't like you to think that I'm a scare-cat
about real things.  I'm jest scared of ghosts, that's all."
</p>

<p>
Lou knit her brows in thought.  "No," she disagreed,
"if you had been that frightened you would not have come
to the grove at all."
</p>

<p>
Billy looked his relief.  "I don't think I'm quite as
bad as I used to be," he said.  "Why say, there was a
time when you couldn't get me inside that grove.  But
lately I've been feelin' different about it.  I don't s'pose
there re'lly is such a thing as a ghost, is there?"
</p>

<p>
"No," she replied, "there's no such thing as a ghost,
Billy."
</p>

<p>
A red squirrel came scampering across the open sod
before them, pausing as he sensed their presence, then
springing to the trunk of a sapling the better to look them
over.
</p>

<p>
"Oh look at the dear little thing," cried the girl.
"What do you suppose he's saying?" as the squirrel
broke into a shrill chatter.
</p>

<p>
"Why he's callin' us all the mean things he knows, I
guess," laughed Billy.  "We're in his way, you see."
</p>

<p>
"Then let's get out of his way.  I suppose he thinks
we have no business here and maybe he's right.  Where
shall we go, Billy?"
</p>

<p>
Billy thought a moment.  "Say, how'd you like to go
out in my punt, on Levee Crick?  I kin show you some
cute baby mushrats an' some dandy black-birds' nests.  It's
not far away.  We go 'cross that big fallow and through a
strip o' hardwoods an' then we climb a stump fence&mdash;an'
there's the crick.  It's an awful fine crick, an' plumb full
of bass an' pike.  Say, will you go?"
</p>

<p>
He leaned toward her, waiting for her answer.  His
heart was singing with joy&mdash;joy that spilled out of his
grey eyes and made his lips smile in spite of him.  What
a sweet and grand privilege it would be to carry this
wonderful girl, who had so transformed his world, along
the familiar by-ways that held such rare treasures of plant
and wild life.
</p>

<p>
She was looking away across the forest to a strip of
fleecy cloud drifting across the deep azure of the sky.
</p>

<p>
"I should like to go," she said at length, "if you are
sure you don't think I will be a bother."
</p>

<p>
"Bother!"  Billy's pulses were leaping, his soul singing.
He reached down a hand and trustingly she put her's
in it.  Very soft and cool it felt to Billy's hot palm, as
he assisted her from the log.  Then side by side they passed
down through the long green valley.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI
</h3>

<h3>
A DAY WITH THE DUCKS
</h3>

<p>
Erie Landon faced her father across the breakfast table,
dimpled chin cupped in her brown hand.  It was early
morning; a red sun was just lifting above the Point to
wipe away the white mists of the channel and the bay.
The American yacht which had put into harbor the night
before had cleared and was now but a white speck in the
distance.
</p>

<p>
"She ought to make Cleveland before dark if this breeze
holds," the light-house keeper said as he twisted the big
cigar which the commodore had given him about in his
fingers.  "Just what word was it that lawyer chap, Maddoc,
wanted us to get to Swanson, at the foot, Erie?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, he asked us to tell Swanson that he and a
friend are coming to his place to stay for a couple of
weeks duck-shooting, Daddy," Erie answered.
</p>

<p>
"When?"
</p>

<p>
"Early in October, Mr. Maddoc said."
</p>

<p>
"Humph!  It does beat all what foolish ideas them big
guns take.  Think of them two comin' all the way from
Cleveland here just to shoot ducks.  Old man Swanson
knows his book, too.  He charges them sports awful prices;
nine dollars a week each and makes 'em sleep two in a
bed at that; and every fall that old ramblin' house of his
is chuck kerbang full of shooters."
</p>

<p>
Landon was much improved in health.  He spoke with
little effort, the hollows in his cheeks were filling and his
eyes were brighter than the girl had seen them for many
a day.  He gazed longingly down at the cigar, then glancing
up to catch his daughter's reproachful look, sighed and
laid it on the table.
</p>

<p>
"I'd love to smoke it," he confessed, "but you needn't
worry, Chick.  I'm through with tobacco till I'm my real
self ag'in.  But I feel so darned much better since I quit
smokin' I simply want to smoke all the more."
</p>

<p>
"Poor old Daddy," Erie laughed, coming around to sit
on the arm of his chair.  "It does seem too bad you can't
have your smoke.  I'm sure you miss it dreadfully; but you
see you are so much stronger and better I&mdash;well, I simply
won't let you smoke just yet, that's all."
</p>

<p>
His face had brightened at the sound of her laughter.
Now he patted her hand, as his eyes sought the window.
Perhaps the old songs would come back even as the laughter
had come and surprise him.  Perhaps she was forgetting
Stanhope.  But no, much as he desired that this should be,
he knew her too well for that.
</p>

<p>
With his eyes on the white sail, now a tiny dot on
the horizon, his mind went back to that scene of a month
ago, when he had told her of Hinter's proposal and of his
consent to it.  He would never quite forget the look that
came into her face.
</p>

<p>
"I could never marry Hinter," she had said.  "I love
one man&mdash;and to him I shall be true, always."
</p>

<p>
"But he is blind, child.  He has given you up," Landon
had reasoned.  And with her face aglow she had answered.
"He is blind, but he can never give me up, because he
loves me."
</p>

<p>
Reading in the dry, suffering eyes she had turned upon
him a purpose stronger than life itself, what could he do
but take her in his arms and ask her to forgive him for
the old meddler he was?  Perhaps he had erred in this.
He did not want to think so.  But she looked so much like
her mother that morning it might be&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Daddy."
</p>

<p>
He came out of his abstraction with a start and glanced
at her, almost guiltily.  "Yes, Chick."
</p>

<p>
"Have you told Mr. Hinter yet?" she asked suddenly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he answered.  "I told him that same day.  Told
him that you said you could never be more to him than
what you now are.  Why do you ask, Erie?"
</p>

<p>
"I have wondered why he keeps coming here," she said
slowly.  "You scarcely need his companionship, now you
are busy with your duties.  But there," she broke off with
a smile, "I have no right to doubt his sincerity; I am
sure he has never spoken one word to me that he should
not speak and I know he is really fond of you."
</p>

<p>
Landon knit his shaggy brows.  "I don't know, Chick.
I'm afraid he still hopes.  He has as much as told me so.
'We've been too hasty with her,' he said, 'we must have
patience.'"
</p>

<p>
Erie's face went very white.  "He mustn't come here
any more," she said quickly.  "With your permission I
shall tell him so, Daddy."
</p>

<p>
He was silent for a time.  "Just as you like," he said
at length.  "If his comin' annoys you, dear, you tell
him so."
</p>

<p>
She bent and kissed him.  "Best Daddy ever was," she
whispered.  Then jumping up she ran to the stove and
put the kettle on.
</p>

<p>
"I saw Billy Wilson yesterday when I was out sailing,"
she called, "and he had the sweetest little girl with him.
Her name is Lou Scroggie and I fell in love with her on
sight."
</p>

<p>
"Billy with a girl!" cried Landon in wonder.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  They were out in Billy's punt, gathering water-lilies,
and, oh Daddy, they seemed so happy.  I could have
hugged them both.  Billy told me that he and Maurice
Keeler were going shooting ducks this morning and I asked
him to come over here for breakfast as usual.  The marsh
shooting is all over by sunrise, you know."
</p>

<p>
Her father nodded.  "I'll bet a cookie that was Billy's
old muzzle loader I heard down in the duck-ponds about
daylight," he laughed.  "Maybe," he added hopefully,
"he'll fetch us a brace of ducks."
</p>

<p>
"Why, there he is now," she cried, glancing through
the window.  "Maurice isn't with him, though.  I know
that old punt as far as I can see it.  I must get the potatoes
and bacon on; he'll be hungry as a bear."
</p>

<p>
Landon put on his hat and went down to the beach to
welcome their visitor.  "Well, Billy," he called as the
punt appeared around the bend in the shore, "how many
ducks did old Liza-Ann drop out of the sky this mornin'?"
</p>

<p>
"Two greys and a mallard," Billy answered over his
shoulder.  "Could'a killed more, but what's the use.  They
wouldn't keep; weather's too warm."
</p>

<p>
"Well now, I can't see why a dozen wouldn't keep as
well as three," returned the keeper, as he pulled the punt
high on shore.
</p>

<p>
"They would, I s'pose," laughed Billy as he stepped
out, followed by Moll, the little spaniel, "but these three
don't have to keep long; you see we're goin' to have
these fer dinner."
</p>

<p>
"Are we now?"  Landon rubbed his hands and smacked
his lips in anticipation.  "You're goin' to stay and help
clean up on 'em, Billy?"
</p>

<p>
"Yep, I'll stay.  I'm goin' to paint Erie's skiff fer her.
I'll slip into the ponds ag'in on my way to the Settlement
an' kill enough ducks fer our folks an' the neighbors."
</p>

<p>
Erie was waving to him from the kitchen door.  "Where's
Maurice?" she called.
</p>

<p>
"His Ma wouldn't let him come.  Afraid he'd get wet
an' go sick ag'in.  Gee! that coffee smells good, Erie."
</p>

<p>
"Go 'long in and tackle it while it's hot," advised Landon.
"I'll start in on pluckin' these birds.  But first we'll
have to let Chick see 'em.  Say, Billy, they're nigh as big
as tame 'uns!"
</p>

<p>
Erie clasped her hands in ecstasy at sight of the wild
ducks.  "Oh, aren't they lovely!" she cried.  "Put them
in the ice-house, Daddy, until Billy starts for home."
</p>

<p>
Billy, who had squared away at his breakfast, spoke with
his mouth full.  "We're goin' to have 'em fer dinner,"
he informed his hostess.
</p>

<p>
"But, Billy," she remonstrated, "they'll be expecting
you to bring some ducks home, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Billy says he'll shoot some more this evenin'," spoke
up her father, who did not intend to allow anything to
interfere with a duck dinner if he could help it.
</p>

<p>
"These ducks wouldn't keep till I get home," said Billy.
</p>

<p>
"No," supported Landon, "weather's too warm, you
see, Chick.  I'll start in on dressin' 'em right now," he
chuckled, exchanging winks with Billy.
</p>

<p>
"You're a pair of plotters," cried Erie, "and being a
weak, helpless girl I suppose I'll have to agree with you
and submissively roast those birds to suit your taste."
</p>

<p>
"You'll find onions and savory hangin' to the rafters
upstairs," suggested her father as he carried the ducks
outside.
</p>

<p>
Erie sat down opposite to Billy, and watched him while
he ate.  He smiled across at her.  "Your Dad seems a
whole lot better," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, ever so much.  He's almost his old self again.  He
has quit smoking, you see, and he has promised me not to
smoke until he is quite well again."
</p>

<p>
Billy laid down his knife and fork and smiled
reminiscently.  "I was jest thinkin' of ol' Harry O'Dule,"
he said, answering the question in her eyes.  "He's quit
a bad habit, too.  He's quit drinkin'; don't touch a drop
any more&mdash;hasn't fer over a month now."
</p>

<p>
"Oh isn't that splendid," cried the girl.  "He's such
a dear old fellow when he's sober.  Do you suppose he'll
be strong enough to give up drink altogether, Billy?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, he seems to be in earnest about it.  I re'lly don't
think he'll drink any more.  He says that he's got his tin
whistle an' his cat an' don't need whisky.  He's changed
wonderful, there's no mistake about that.  Ma saw him
yesterday.  He was dressed in his Prince Albert an' plug
hat, an' Ma says he was that changed she didn't know him
at first."
</p>

<p>
Erie laughed softly, "I know very well you've had a
hand in his reform, Billy," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Nope," denied Billy, "but I ain't sayin' but that my
owls an' snakes might have played a part in it."  And he
proceeded to relate the deception he had practiced on Harry
while the old man was in his cups.
</p>

<p>
The girl clapped her hands in joy at the story.  "And
you let him think he had the delirium tremens!  Oh, Billy,
is there anything you wouldn't do, I wonder?"
</p>

<p>
Billy shook his head.  "I dunno," he replied.  "That's
a hard question to answer."
</p>

<p>
Silence fell between them.  He knew that she was thinking
that last year on the opening morning of the duck season
Frank Stanhope had sat at this table with him.  She
was gazing from the window, far down to where the Point
was lost in the Settlement forests.  He saw her bosom rise
and fall, saw a tear grow up in her eyes and roll unheeded
down her cheek.
</p>

<p>
In boyish sympathy his hand reached out to clasp the
slender brown one clenched upon the white cloth.  He
longed to ask her if what the Settlement was saying&mdash;that
she was going to marry Hinter&mdash;was true.  And then as
quickly as the thought itself came shame of it.  His hand
clasped her hand more tightly.
</p>

<p>
"He went with me to the foot of the Causeway last
night, ag'in," he said softly.
</p>

<p>
She turned and the blood mounted swiftly to her white
cheeks.  "And did he feel the light again, Billy?" she
whispered eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"He felt the light," said the boy, "an' he sang all the
way back home."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" she cried and hid her face on her arms.
</p>

<p>
Billy arose hastily, saying something about helping her
father with the ducks and went outside.  He found
Landon seated on a soap-box behind the boat house,
industriously stripping the ducks of their feathers.
</p>

<p>
"Say," said the man as Billy came up, "you know
when ducks put on an extra coverin' of feathers a hard
winter is in sight?  Well, by gosh, these birds have all put
on an extra undershirt.  Look," holding the duck in his
hands up for inspection.  "How's that for a coat o'
down?"
</p>

<p>
"It sure is heavy," agreed Billy.  "I saw another sure
sign over there in the ponds that says it's goin' to be
a hard winter, one I've never knowed to fail.  It was the
mushrat houses.  The rats are throwin' 'em up mighty big
an' thick."
</p>

<p>
"And warm, I'll bet."
</p>

<p>
"Yep, an' warm.  We're sure to have a rough fall an'
a humdinger of a winter."
</p>

<p>
"And I s'pose a rough fall means good duckin'?"
laughed Landon.  "Oh, by the way, Billy, before I forget.
Would you mind runnin' in to old Swanson's landin' on
your way home and tellin' him that a couple of fellers
from Cleveland are comin' to his place early next month
to shoot.  They were here last night.  One of em's a lawyer
named Maddoc an' he give me this money to pass on to
Swanson, so's the old codger would be sure and hold a
room for 'em."
</p>

<p>
He felt in his vest pocket and fished out a ten dollar note,
which he handed to Billy.  "Maddoc and a party of other
men were cruisin' in a yacht.  They docked here last
night," he explained.  "Left at sunup for Cleveland."
</p>

<p>
"I saw the yacht leave the pier," said Billy.  "She sure
was a dandy, wasn't she?"
</p>

<p>
"Never saw finer lines than her's," agreed Landon.
"You're sure you don't mind gettin' that word to Swanson
now, Billy?"
</p>

<p>
"Not a bit.  I'll run in to his dock tonight, an' tell
him."
</p>

<p>
"Good.  There, thank goodness this job of pluckin's
done at last.".  Landon rose, rubbed his cramped legs and
gathered the stripped ducks up by the necks.  "We'll
leave the rest to Erie," he chuckled.  "This is about as
far as she ever lets me go.  Comin' in?"
</p>

<p>
Billy shook his head.  "I've got a skiff to paint 'fore
three o'clock this afternoon," he said, "so I best get busy.
Tell Erie not to ferget to blow the fog-horn when the ducks
are done."
</p>

<p>
Landon went on slowly to the kitchen.  With his hand
on the door-latch he paused and a smile lit his seamed face.
Above the clatter of dishes came a girl's sweet soprano:
</p>

<p>
  "Her voice was low and sweet,<br />
  And she's all the world to me,<br />
  And for bonnie Annie Laurie<br />
  I'd lay me down and dee."<br />
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
"I knowed it," whispered the man, softly.  "I knowed
the old songs would come back ag'in.  Billy must have had
somethin' to do with it; I'll bet a cookie he had!"  He
opened the door gently and entered.  He placed the ducks
on the table and softly withdrew again.
</p>

<p>
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
It was late afternoon when Billy stepped into his punt
and with swift, strong strokes sent it skimming toward
the duck-ponds.  At the point where the shore curved
abruptly he lifted his hat and waved to the man and girl
watching him from the pier.
</p>

<p>
Moll looked up into his face and whined.  "Don't worry,
girlie," Billy told her, "we're goin' on, but we're comin'
back ag'in soon an' have another o' Erie's duck dinners,
an' Teacher Stanhope's goin to be with us, don't you
ferget that."
</p>

<p>
As he spoke, he saw another boat round the distant
grass-point and put into Jerunda cut, the entrance to the main
pond.  The smile left his face.  "Beat us to it, Moll," he
sighed to the spaniel whose brown eyes had also glimpsed
the skiff.  "They'll be set by the time we get in an' they've
got the pick of the ponds, no use denyin' that.  We'll have
to portage 'cross to a back slough an' all the ducks we'll
get a chance at are them they miss.  Well, cheer up," as
the dog, sensing the disgust in his voice, growled deep in
her throat.
</p>

<p>
Reaching the cut Billy found the other shooters having
some difficulty in getting their heavy skiff through the
shallow and deceptive water, a feat which only one who
was used to navigating could hope to accomplish successfully.
At the same time he noted, with a start, that the
men in the skiff were the mysterious drillers, Tom and
Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Hello, you!" he shouted.  "You'll have to back up
an' take the run to your left."
</p>

<p>
The larger of the two men grunted a surly response and
with much pushing and swearing they began to laboriously
back out of the blind channel.  Billy and Moll watched
them, the dog growling her antagonism of the interlopers.
As the skiff passed his bow Billy noted that the guns lying
across the seat were both of the new breech-loading pattern.
</p>

<p>
The occupants of the skiff cast a contemptuous look at
his old muzzle-loader, as they passed, and one of them
laughed and said something in an aside to his companion.
</p>

<p>
"Do you expect to kill any ducks with that old iron?"
he sneered, looking hard at Billy.
</p>

<p>
Billy felt his cheeks turn hot.  "I might," he returned,
"an' ag'in, I mightn't."
</p>

<p>
"That's one on you, Tom," laughed the man named
Jack.  "Quit roasting the kid.  We'd have been mired yet
if it hadn't been for him."
</p>

<p>
Tom allowed a shade of amiability to creep into his tones
as he said: "First time we ever shot these grounds, and
we're kinder green on the ins and outs of 'em.  We're
drillin' fer water down in the Settlement.  Lost our drill
this mornin' and had to send across the lake fer a fishin'
outfit, so thought we'd put in the time shootin' a bit."
</p>

<p>
Billy made no reply.
</p>

<p>
"Neeborly, ain't he?" growled Tom to his companion.
"Nice, friendly sorter youngsters they raise on this God
forsaken spot, I say."
</p>

<p>
"He thinks you're guyin' him," said the other man.
"How's he to know what you mean by 'fishin'-outfit?'  He
likely thinks you mean a rod and reel.  Better push
along and mind your own business.  Next thing you're goin'
to say is somethin' about 'shootin' a well,' and if Jacobs
gets to hear of that kinder talk&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
They were moving off, and Billy did not hear the rest
of the sentence.  As they entered the main run, the smaller
man called: "Hey, sonny, whereabouts is the best point
in yonder?"
</p>

<p>
Billy gritted his teeth.  He resented these strangers
coming into his shooting grounds and acting as though they
owned them.  For them to expect him to show them just
where the best point was to be found seemed to him to be
going a whole lot too far.  He disliked and distrusted them.
From what he had seen and heard of them he believed they
were the men who robbed the Twin Oaks store.  He wanted
to tell them so now, but something told him to curb his
temper and act the part of a sport who could afford to
make certain allowances.
</p>

<p>
"The best point's straight ahead of you," he answered.
"You'll find a rush blind already built on it."
</p>

<p>
He picked up his paddle and followed in the wake of
the other boat.  The men were putting out their decoys as
Billy passed the point.
</p>

<p>
"Say, you," called Tom, "if this is such an all-fired
good spot it's a wonder you didn't take it yourself; you
had lots of time to beat us to it, didn't you?"
</p>

<p>
"You was in the run first, wasn't you?" said Billy,
coldly.
</p>

<p>
"Why, sure we was, but we were stuck tight.  You
might have passed us, easy enough."
</p>

<p>
"Well, we don't play the game that way in these parts,"
said Billy and passed on, unheedful of the uncomplimentary
names the chagrined driller threw after him.
</p>

<p>
Half way down the long pond he drew into shore and,
pulling the punt after him through the tall rushes, made
the portage across to the inner slough.  It was a long, hard
pull, but the track he laid would make the return portage
much easier.
</p>

<p>
"Looks like a good feedin' place, Moll," he addressed
the spaniel as he paddled slowly across to the far shore
of the slough.  "Good grass here fer hidin', too; but not
much chance of findin' a down bird without a good dog,
an' I've got her&mdash;eh girlie?"
</p>

<p>
Moll wagged her short tail gleefully.
</p>

<p>
"Now then, girlie, it's comin' on to flight-time, so well
jest set out decoys right here."  Billy picked up the wooden
ducks and placed them as naturally as he knew how some
twenty yards out from shore.  As he drew the punt well
up among the tall rushes he saw the first line of ducks
drift in from the bay.
</p>

<p>
"Down, Moll!" he whispered, as he cocked the old
muzzle-loader.  "They're headin' straight in.  Them driller
fellers are goin' to get a chance to make a clean-up on that
bunch, sure!"
</p>

<p>
Straight across the marsh, following the cut, the ducks
came on, half a dozen big "blacks," with long necks
outstretched and quick eyes seeking for feeding ones of their
own kind.  Then, suddenly, the leader gave a soft quack
and Billy saw the flock swoop low.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, gollies!  Right into their decoys," he groaned.
"Now they'll give it to 'em, jest as they're settlin'."
</p>

<p>
A long, harrowing moment passed.  Then quickly and
close together four shots rang out.  Moll whined dolefully
and Billy, peering through the rushes, gave a low whistle
of surprise.  "Didn't down a single bird," he muttered,
"an' by gollies, they've sent 'em right across to us."
</p>

<p>
Almost simultaneously with his words the whistle of
strong wings grew up and the six big blacks swept in, low
over his decoys.
</p>

<p>
It was a sure hand that raised the old gun, a sure eye
that glanced along its brown barrels.  At the first loud
report of the black powder the leader of the flock crumpled
up and the second in command drifted sidewise from the
flock.  The left barrel spoke and a third duck twisted from
the remainder of the flock, to fall with a splash into the
water.
</p>

<p>
Moll, whose eyes had never left the second bird down,
had slipped quietly away through the rushes.  Billy, having
launched the punt and retrieved the two birds on the water,
found her waiting for him on shore, the dead duck in her
mouth.  He patted her brown side and spoke a word of
commendation to her; then quickly he reloaded.
</p>

<p>
The sun was almost on the western horizon now and the
ducks were beginning to come in fast, most of them from
off the bay; consequently the shooters in the front pond
had always first chance.  But Billy knew they were having
little or no success.  Every duck that offered itself as a
target to them he saw almost as soon as they did and
although the report of their guns sounded at quick intervals
the ducks seemed to keep on, straight across to where he
crouched with the excited dog by his side.
</p>

<p>
By the time the sun had fallen behind the far rim of
forest he was quite content with his evening's bag, which
consisted of five blacks, a pair of greys, two blue winged
teal, a pintail and a pair of green headed mallards.
</p>

<p>
Quickly he made the portage and crossed the pond into
Jerunda.  He could hear the other shooters ahead of him,
speaking in profane tones of disgust at their luck.  He
found them waiting for him on the edge of the bay, but
he kept right on paddling.
</p>

<p>
"What luck, sonny?" called the man, Tom, as he passed.
</p>

<p>
Billy told him of his bag.
</p>

<p>
The man swore and said something to his companion.
"Hey, hold up!  Want to sell part of them ducks?" he
asked.
</p>

<p>
"Nope."  Billy shipped his paddle and picked up his
oars.  Somehow he felt safer then.  He believed that men like
those behind were capable of almost any crime.  What if
they should make up their minds to have his ducks
anyway?  Well, they couldn't catch him now.  There were
two of them in a heavy skiff and he was alone in his light
punt, so let them try it if they wanted to.  But whatever
might have been their thought, it was clear they knew
better than pursue that swiftly moving boat.  Quickly they
fell behind him and were swallowed up in the deepening
shadows.

CHAPTER XXII
<br /><br />
TEACHER JOHNSTON RESIGNS
</h3>

<p>
September passed laden with summer perfumes and song
and, beneath a blanket of hoar frost, October awoke to
send her hazy heralds far across wooded upland and open.
Slowly those wreathing mists kissed leaf and fern, as
though whispering: "Rest sweetly, until spring brings you
back once again."
</p>

<p>
So it seemed to the boy, as from the brow of a hill he
watched the dawn-haze drift toward the newly-open
sun-gates of the eastern sky; for autumn always brought a
feeling of sadness to Billy.  He missed the twitter of the
birds, the thousand and one notes of the wild things he
loved and which always passed out and away from his
world with the summer.  The first hoar frost had come;
soon the leaves would turn golden and crimson, the
fern-clumps crumple and wither into sere, dead, scentless
things.  Then with shortening days and darkening skies
those leaves and plants would sag to earth and the gaunt
arms of the bare trees would lift empty nests toward
snow-spitting skies.
</p>

<p>
No more would the fire-flies weave a gauze of golden
stars above the marshlands at the foot of the Causeway.
The season of green and blue had lived and died and in
its place had been born a season of drab and brown.
Summer was gone.  The song-birds had migrated.  Soon
the green rush fields would sway, grey and dead and the
bronze woodcocks would whistle away from the bog-lands,
for seldom did they tarry after the first frost.  Along the
creek the red-winged black-birds would be sounding their
up-and-away notes.  No happy carol to welcome the first
glow of dawn!  No wonder Billy sighed.  Then he lifted
his head quickly as, high above him, sounded the whistle
of wings.  Up from the north a wedgeshaped flock of wild
ducks came speeding, white backs flashing as they pitched
downward in unbroken formation towards the calling
bay-waters.
</p>

<p>
Billy caught his breath quickly and a glad smile drove
the shadow from his face.  "Canvasbacks!" he murmured,
"They've come early.  I bet anythin' the flocks I heard
comin' in through the night was canvasbacks, too&mdash;an'
redhead!  I must go right over after breakfast an' tell
Teacher Stanhope; he'll be sure to say 'Let's go get
'em.'  Oh, gee!"
</p>

<p>
He turned back toward the house, then paused as the
mellow "whirt-o-whirt" of a quail sounded from the
sumach which bordered the meadow across the road.  "Old
Cock quail," he cautioned softly, "I wouldn't give that
covey-call too often if I was you.  Joe Scraff jest might
hear you.  Only note safe fer you to whistle is 'Bob White'&mdash;but
you won't be whistlin' that till spring comes ag'in."
</p>

<p>
It may be that the white-throated leader of the brown
covey in the stubble sensed the murmured warning of his
friend, for he did not whistle again.  The smile still on
his lips, Billy vaulted the rail fence and sought the path
to the house.
</p>

<p>
He found his father, mother and Anson seated at the
breakfast table and as he took his place he was conscious
of a foreboding of impending storm.  The conviction was
strengthened when his father's foot, reaching sympathetically
underneath the table, touched his ever so gently.  With
perfect sangfroid he speared a strip of bacon with his fork
and held his breath as he waited for the worst.  Two taps
of that foot meant "On your guard," three taps "Watch
out for dodging."
</p>

<p>
He received two taps and sighed relievedly; then as his
mother arose to bring the coffee-pot from the stove he felt
three quick and distinct pressures and ducked his head
just in time to miss a swinging, open-handed slap from
Mrs. Wilson's heavy hand.
</p>

<p>
Anson, sitting slit-eyed and gleeful close beside him,
received the slap with a force that knocked his face into
his porridge bowl.
</p>

<p>
As Mrs. Wilson recovered her balance and squared away
for a surer stroke, Croaker swooped in through the open
door and, with many muffled croaks, alighted in the center
of the table.  In his black beak he held another glittering
gold piece, which he dropped in front of Mrs. Wilson's
plate.  Then picking up a fat doughnut from the platter
he hopped to the motto <i>God Bless Our Home</i> and perching
himself on its gilt frame proceeded to appease his morning's
hunger.
</p>

<p>
Silence fell upon the family after the first gasp of
surprise at sight of the gold piece.  Even Anson checked his
wailing to sit with his pale eyes wider open than ever they
had been before and it was he who broke the silence which
had fallen&mdash;broke it with a husky, fear-ridden voice as
he cried:
</p>

<p>
"Fer goodness sake, Ma, don't touch that gold!  It's
bewitched, I tell you!"
</p>

<p>
His mother glared at him.  "Humph!" she snorted,
"you're bewitched yourself, you poor coward you!  Now
then, another word out o' you&mdash;and you get the strap.
Ain't I told you, Anson, time and ag'in, that this dear
crow has found old Scroggie's pile?  You git up from this
table to once; go out and stay within callin' distance; I'll
want you back here presently."
</p>

<p>
She picked up the gold piece and, fondling it lovingly,
waited until Anson had passed outside.  Then with
characteristic deliberation she placed it safely away beneath
her saucer, thereby signifying that the incident was closed
for the time being.
</p>

<p>
It was not until Billy had finished his breakfast and was
about to slip quietly out that his mother spoke again.
Then fixing him with cold, accusing eyes, she said: "I
want 'a know what you had to do with scarin' the new
teacher so he won't never come back to the Valley School
ag'in, Willium."
</p>

<p>
Billy, who had anticipated what was coming, gave a
well-feigned start.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Ma," he cried, in amazement, "you don't mean
to say he's gone?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, he's gone an' I s'pose you're satisfied, you and
your outlaw companions in crime.  Cobin Keeler stopped
by this mornin' and he told us the teacher left his writ'
resign in his hands.  He declares he won't risk his life
among a lot of young savages."
</p>

<p>
"I think that Mr. Johnston went a little too far there,"
Wilson ventured.
</p>

<p>
"You shet right up, Tom!" commanded his wife.
"Ain't it nuthin' to you that your son grows up wild and
uneddicated?"
</p>

<p>
"But he had no right to call us savages, Ma,"
protested Billy.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, hadn't he then!  Well, who up and deliberately
stole his horse, I'd like to know?"  Mrs. Wilson held her
breath waiting for the answer.
</p>

<p>
"Nobody stole his horse," replied Billy.  "The poor
thing was so lean an' hungry that it weaved when it walked;
all we did was sneak it out o' the school-yard an' hide it
where there was good pasture."
</p>

<p>
"Well, maybe that ain't stealin' it, but if it ain't what
would you call it, Willium?"
</p>

<p>
"I'd call it bein' kind to dumb animals," spoke up Wilson,
his eyes meeting the angry ones of his wife.
</p>

<p>
"Listen, Ma," said Billy gently.  "That old Johnston
was awful mean to us kids, there's no mistake about that.
He whipped us fer nothin', an' what's worse, he was
always sneerin' at us fer being low-born an' ignorant, an'
that meant sayin' things ag'in our folks.  But we was
willin' to stand all that, cause we'd promised Teacher
Stanhope that we'd do our best to put up with the teacher in
his place.  But, Ma, if you could'a seen that poor ol'
horse, so starved that every rib showed like the ridges in
your wash-board, lookin' over that school-yard fence at
the long grass an' beggin' with his hungry eyes fer jest
a bite&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Billy paused and rolled a bread crumb.  When he looked
up his eyes were dark.  "Anse has told you that it was
me who sneaked him out o' the yard, an' led him away
where he could feed an' rest an' get the sores made by the
hard saddle an' hickory healed, an' Anse didn't lie fer
once.  I did do it, an' I'd do it ag'in.
</p>

<p>
"What's more, Ma, that ol' horse is goin' to stay right
where he is, belly-deep in clover, till it gets so cold we'll
have to stable him.  Then he's goin' to have all the good
hay an' oats he wants."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson could scarcely believe her ears.  "You don't
mean that havin' took him you had any thoughts of keepin'
him, Willium?" she managed to say.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Ma'am; I mean jest that.  You see, Ma, that ol'
horse don't belong to Teacher Johnston any more.  We
bought him."
</p>

<p>
"Bought him!" exclaimed man and woman in a breath.
</p>

<p>
Billy nodded.  "Me an' Jim Scroggie bought him from
Mr. Johnston, an' we got a receipt provin' our ownership,
too, you bet.  This is how we did it.  'Long 'bout the
second er third day after ol' Thomas disappeared me an'
Jim met up with Johnston walkin' home from school to
Fairfield where he boards.  Jim had fifty dollars, all his
own, an' we'd planned jest what we'd say to the teacher.
</p>

<p>
"First off when he sees us, he asks us if we'd happened
to find any tracks of his horse.  It was funny to see his
snakey eyes callin' us liars at every polite word we said to
him.  Finally he comes right out flat-footed an' tells us
that he knows we had somethin' to do with ol' Thomas
wanderin' off, an' he says he's goin' to make our fathers
pay fer his loss."
</p>

<p>
"Course we got real scared then&mdash;leastwise Johnston
thought we was&mdash;an' Jim he ups an' tells him that we
fergot to latch the gate an' let the horse out.  Then
Johnston got real mean&mdash;meaner than I ever see him get, an'
that's sayin' quite a lot.  He said he would turn back with
us an' interview&mdash;that's the word he used, whatever it
means&mdash;interview our fathers.
</p>

<p>
"Then Jim he begged him not to do that.  'We'll pay
you whatever's right fer your horse, sir,' he says, but
Johnston jest snorted.  'Where would you get fifty
dollars!' he says, but Jim, he nudged me to keep quiet, an'
said: 'I've got fifty dollars of my very own, right here,
sir.  We'll buy your horse an' take chances on findin'
him, if you'll sell him to us.'
</p>

<p>
"'Gimme the money,' says Johnston.
</p>

<p>
"So we give him the money but we made him give us
what Jim calls a regular bill o' sale receipt fer it.  An' so,
you see, Ma, we've got Mr. Johnston there, an' he won't
ever lay the rod on poor ol' Thomas no more."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson, arms folded on the white table-cloth, was
gazing out of the window now.  Perhaps she saw a poor
old horse, belly deep in luscious grass, making up for the
fasts of hard and stern days, mercifully behind it forever
now and enjoying life to the full&mdash;the new life which
Billy had helped to purchase.
</p>

<p>
At any rate, her voice had lost much of its harshness as
she asked: "But what about the wild animal that broke
into the school an' tore the teacher's clothes fair off his
back an' chased him up the road?  That's the thing that
scared him so he quit the school ferever.  Now, Willium,
what did you have to do with that?"
</p>

<p>
Billy sat silent, striving to keep back the grin that would
come in spite of him.  Wilson, on pretext of getting his
pipe, got up and left the room.
</p>

<p>
"I'm waitin', Willium."
</p>

<p>
"Well, Ma, you see ol' Ringdo got out of his cage
yesterday mornin'.  I've kept him shut up a lot an' what
with feedin' on meat an' rich stuff that old swamp coon
was playfuller than usual, I guess.  It seems Teacher
Johnston had took a notion to get down to the school at
eight o'clock instead of nine as he usually does.  When
Teacher Stanhope taught school Ringdo used t' often go
there an' get apples an' stuff that the teacher saved for
him.  Yesterday when he got loose he must've been lonesome
fer Mr. Stanhope, an' he went to the school.  He got
in an' found Johnston alone, I guess, an' maybe tried to
get friendly.  Mr. Johnston must have kicked him er hit
him.  All I know about it is what I seen fer myself.
</p>

<p>
"I was goin' down the path to the road, Anse with me,
when the teacher went past, runnin' fer all he was worth.
Come to think of it his coat had been clawed some, an' I
remember now his face was bleedin' from a scratch er two.
He didn't see us an' he didn't stop.  He kept right on
goin'.  Anse an' me went on to the school, an' there we
found Ringdo jest finishin' the teacher's lunch.  I brought
him back an' put him in his cage.  That's all, Ma, an' it's
every blessed word true."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson remained thoughtful.  Billy, watching her
with furtive speculation, hoped from the relaxing lines in
her brow that all was well with the world once more.  Hope
became an assurance with her next words.
</p>

<p>
"You kin have that Jim Scroggie over to supper tonight,
Willium, if you want to."
</p>

<p>
Billy's heart jumped with joy.  He wanted to hug his
mother, but restrained the desire and sat gazing pensively
at his plate.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter, don't you want him?" asked his
mother.  "I thought maybe you'd like to have him, seein's
you're such cronies an' there must be some good in him in
spite of his looks.  I could have them partridges that Joe
Scraff sent over roasted with bacon strips across 'em, an'
baked potatoes, an' maybe I might boil an apple dumplin'."
</p>

<p>
Billy sighed.  "That's awful good of you, Ma, an' I
sure would like to have Jim over to supper, but he's so
fond of his sister he won't go anywheres without her, you
see."
</p>

<p>
"Well," flared his mother, "can't he fetch her along
with him, if he wants to?  What's to hinder him from
fetchin' her?  She's a sweet little thing an' I'd be proud
to have her."
</p>

<p>
Billy closed his eyes and took tight hold of his chair seat.
He knew that if he did not summon all his self restraint
he would surely spoil all he had accomplished through
strategy.  He longed to swoop down on his mother and
hug her, slap her on the back and yell in her ear that she
was a brick.  But experience had taught him caution.  And
besides, Billy reasoned, there was still something more to
be accomplished.
</p>

<p>
"I say we kin have Louie over, too, Willium," Mrs. Wilson
suggested once again.
</p>

<p>
"Yep, we could do that, I s'pose," said Billy, "only&mdash;"  He
frowned and shook his head.  "I guess we best
not ask either of 'em, Ma.  Maurice might hear of it, an'
wonder why he wa'n't asked too.  He's awful funny that
way, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Why, sakes alive!" cried his mother, "I never give
Maurice a thought.  O' course we'll have him, too.  An'
if there happens to be anybody else you'd like, you best
say so now, Willium."
</p>

<p>
"I'd awful like to have Harry O'Dule, too."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson caught her breath, but whatever objections
her mind raised against the last named remained unuttered.
All she said was.  "This is your party, Willium.
Anybody else, now?"
</p>

<p>
"Elgin Scraff," spoke up Billy, promptly.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson looked out of the window and considered.
"Let's see.  That leaves little Louie the only girl among
all of you boys, so we'll jest have to have another girl er
two.  How'd you like to have Ann Spencer and Phoebe
Scraff?"
</p>

<p>
Billy agreed with delight.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wilson pushed back her chair and arose from the
table.  "Now, then, Willium, you get along out.  I've got
a whole lot to do afore supper-time, and I guess maybe
you best run across and ask Mrs. Keeler to come over and
help me.  You kin go 'round and give the invites to your
friends."
</p>

<p>
She picked up the saucer and stood looking down at the
gold piece which Croaker had brought in.  "I don't
s'pose there's a particle of use keepin' an eye on that
crow?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Haven't I been keepin' an eye on him?" cried Billy,
"an' you see what he does.  Jest as soon as I turn my
back he plays sharp.  I've done my best to get him to
show me where he finds that gold, but he won't do it.
But I'll catch him yet.  I'll jest run along an' see what
he's at now; he's so quiet I know he's into some mischief."
</p>

<p>
He picked up his hat and bounded outside.  He found
Croaker seated on the chicken yard fence, gravely
surveying his ancient and mortal enemy, the old game cock,
and whispering guttural insults that fairly made the
rooster bristle with anger.
</p>

<p>
Billy shook his fist at the crow.  "You old beggar," he
said fondly, "if that rooster was wise he'd go out with
the rest of the chickens an' scratch his breakfast, 'stead o'
quarrelin' with you.  He don't know that you're doin' your
best to starve him to death."
</p>

<p>
Billy knew that Croaker would hang close to his enemy
all morning and feeling reasonably sure that no further
trips to the hidden treasure would be made during his
absence on his mother's errand he started for Keeler's.  At
the road gate he met Cobin coming in, a pitchfork on his
shoulder.  Keeler and Billy's father "changed works"
during wheat and corn harvest, and the former was coming
over to help haul in fodder.
</p>

<p>
"Ho, Billy!" he boomed, gripping the lad's arm in his
huge hand, "you won't steal Maurice away from the work
I've set him to do this mornin', I'll be bound.  Back to the
house you come with me, young man.  I want Maurice to
finish his job."
</p>

<p>
"I don't want Maurice," Billy hastened to explain.
"Ma wants Missus Keeler to come over an' give her a hand,
so I'm on my way to tell her.  Honest, Mr. Keeler, that's
right."
</p>

<p>
"By Jimminy, you've fooled me so many times, Billy, I
have an idea you might jest do it ag'in."  Mr. Keeler's
grip tightened, and his smile broadened.  "Cross your
heart, it's right?"
</p>

<p>
"Yep, cross my heart, an' spit on my thumb," grinned
Billy.
</p>

<p>
Keeler's roaring laugh might have been heard half a
mile away.  "Well, along you go," he shouted, lifting
Billy bodily over the gate.  "You'll find Ma deefer than
usual on account of a cold in the head, so talk real close
and loud to her."
</p>

<p>
Billy found Mrs. Keeler peeling onions in the cook-house
and after some trouble made her understand what was
wanted.  While she was shedding her apron and hunting
for her hat he went outside.  Maurice's school-books and
slate lay on the bench beneath the hop vine.  Billy grinned
as his eyes fell on them.  He climbed to the top of the
gate-post and searched the surrounding fields for his chum,
locating him finally down near the ditch, a lonely and
pathetic figure seated on a little knoll, methodically topping
mangles with a sickle.  His back was toward Billy and it
took all the latter's self restraint to refrain from giving
the rally call, but he remembered what he had promised
Maurice's father.  So he slid down from the post and
picking up the slate, produced a stub of slate-pencil from
a pocket and wrote a message in symbols.  Then on the
other side of the slate he duplicated the message, adding
the necessary key to the code.  This was the message that
Billy wrote:
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-240"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-240.jpg" alt="Billy's message" />
<br />
</p>

<p>
When Mrs. Keeler came out, laden with bake-pans and
other kitchen utensils, Billy led her carefully across the
stubble by a new route, nor did she dream his motive in
so doing was to keep the house between them and the
lonesome mangle-topper in the valley.

CHAPTER XXIII
<br /><br />
MR. HINTER PROVES A PUZZLE
</h3>

<p>
October's second morning dawned sullen and grey, with
a chill wind banking slate-hued clouds in the sky.  Deacon
Ringold, taking the short cut across the stubble-fields to
Wilson's, shivered as he glanced back at the black lines
his feet had cut through the crisp white frost, and decided
to put on his woolen underclothes right away.  The deacon
had important and disturbing news to convey to his
neighbor and had started out early to seek his counsel.
</p>

<p>
As he climbed the rail fence his eyes swept the Settlement
below, resting at length on the jail-like wall in the
edge of the Scroggie timber, above which the tall derrick
protruded like a white, scarred face.  "Humph!" he mused,
"Scroggie and Hinter must either have struck water, or
give up.  Their rig's quiet after chuggin' away day and
night for weeks."
</p>

<p>
He glanced in the opposite direction to the blue smoke
rising above the Wilson cedars.  Then, as he prepared to
climb down, he apparently changed his mind, for instead
of taking the path to Tom Wilson's he walked briskly
down toward the walled in derrick.  Reaching it he paused
and an exclamation of surprise escaped him.  On the door
of the wall an iron padlock had been fastened.  There was
no sign of human life about the place but within the walls
could be heard the fierce growling of dogs.  Ringold
backed away and eyed the tall derrick.  There was mystery
here and he didn't relish mysteries.  And there was a
pungent, salty smell about the place&mdash;the smell that oily
machinery gives off when put under intense heat.
</p>

<p>
The deacon was curious to learn what caused that smell.
He approached a little closer to the walls and scrutinized
the ground carefully.  It was stained with black patches
of something and he saw that the planks of the wall and
the portion of the derrick showing above it also were stained
a greenish-black.  He ran a finger over a greasy splash and
sniffed.  Then he backed away slowly, now nodding his
head.  He knew what had happened, just as well as though
he had seen it.  The careless drillers had exploded a
barrel of coal-oil, and perhaps wrecked the drill.  Yes,
nothing surer.  That had been the explosion which shook the
windows of his home and awoke him several nights ago.
Keeler and Wilson had heard it too.  Well, it was too bad
after all the trouble and expense Scroggie had gone to to
find water for the Settlement.
</p>

<p>
So the deacon went thoughtfully on his way to Wilson's.
He found Tom Wilson breakfasting alone.  To the deacon's
look of surprise his neighbor vouchsafed the information
that a glad and glorious band of young people had been
"cuttin' up" nearly all night there, and the boys and
Ma were sleepin' in, like.
</p>

<p>
Ringold hung his hat on the stovepoker and got down
to business at once.  "Say, Tom, I've had an offer for my
back hundred.  Don' know whether to sell or not.  Thought
I'd like to hear what you'd advise."
</p>

<p>
Wilson drained his cup and set it down in the saucer,
methodically.  The news did not seem to surprise him.
"Who made the offer, Hinter?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
The deacon started.  "Yes, did he tell you about it?"
</p>

<p>
"No," Wilson pushed back his chair and felt for his
pipe, "but he seems to want to own the whole Settlement.
He made me an offer for my place and he tried to buy
Cobin Keeler's farm, too, so Cobin says."
</p>

<p>
"When, Tom, when?" asked Ringold, eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"Last night.  At least that's when he made me my offer
an' he must have gone across to Cobin's after he left me.
Cobin jest left here not ten minutes ago.  He come over
to tell me all about it."
</p>

<p>
The deacon sat silent, thinking.  "What's their game,
Tom?" he asked suddenly.
</p>

<p>
"His game you mean."
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't either, I mean his and Scroggie's game;
of course Scroggie's behind him."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," agreed Wilson, "I guess maybe he is.  But,
Deacon, I don't know what their game is; wish I did."
</p>

<p>
"Did you talk sell, Tom?" asked Ringold, anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"No sir," his neighbor answered promptly, "I should
say not."
</p>

<p>
"And Cobin&mdash;he ain't any head at all, poor Cobin&mdash;did
he talk sell?"
</p>

<p>
Wilson laughed.  "Not Cobin.  He's quite satisfied with
his little farm, I guess.  No, Hinter didn't get much
satisfaction from either of us."
</p>

<p>
The deacon jumped up and reached for his hat.  "Tom,
I'm goin' to saddle your roan and go ask a few questions
of the other farmers, if you don't mind."
</p>

<p>
"Good idea," agreed his neighbor.  "Here, you best
set down and have a cup of coffee and I'll saddle him,
myself."
</p>

<p>
"No coffee, thanks; had breakfast; I'll go 'long with
you.  Oh, by the way, Tom, I know now what caused that
explosion t'other night," and the deacon proceeded to
relate his investigation of the walled-in well.
</p>

<p>
Wilson listened interestedly, until Ringold was through.
"Well, they've been careful enough about hidin' their
good work, at any rate," he said.  "You'd think they had
somethin' mighty precious inside them walls the way
they've guarded it; but I'm sorry if they've met with an
accident," he added.  "Hinter did really seem anxious to
get water."
</p>

<p>
They went out to the stable and Wilson saddled the
roan.  "I'll be back in an hour or so," called the deacon
as he rode away.
</p>

<p>
He was as good as his word.  Wilson was just finishing
the morning's milking, when the deacon returned.  "No
other offers, Tom," he said.  "Looks as though they were
after this particular strip of territory.  Anyhow it's
agreed that none of us will sell or rent without consultin'
the others, so I guess we can wait on Hinter's game all
right."
</p>

<p>
"Didn't see Scraff, did you?" asked Wilson.
</p>

<p>
"No, I didn't.  Joe had left for Bridgetown to bring in
a couple of duck-hunters to old man Swanson's.
Clevelanders, they are, so I didn't see him."
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid Joe'll sell, if he gets a good offer,"
reflected Wilson.
</p>

<p>
"No, he'll stick with the rest of us," cried Ringold,
emphatically, "and I'll tell you why.  It's just like his
contrariness to do the very thing the others won't do, but
let me tell you somethin'.  The very minute he makes a
move I put the screws on him tight.  Let him so much as
whisper 'sell' an' he'll pay me every cent he owes me,
with interest.  No, Tom, we needn't feel scarey about Joe
Scraff."
</p>

<p>
"Well," laughed Wilson, "if anybody kin make Joe
toe the scratch it's you, Deacon.  Didn't see anythin' of
Hinter on your rounds, did you?"
</p>

<p>
"No, but I met Scroggie.  That feller improves on
acquaintance, Tom, he does so!  He ain't half bad after
you get to know him.  He seems to want to be neighborly,
and while I think he's backing Hinter in some way I've
an idea he's watching him pretty close."
</p>

<p>
"Say anythin' to him about Hinter's offer to buy?"
</p>

<p>
"Nary a word but I asked him what he intended to do
with the Scroggie hardwoods.  He told me that he had
sold it to a lumber company.  He says there'll be a big
camp of cutters and sawyers down here this winter.  I
said I supposed he'd be goin' back to the States jest as
soon as he got things cleared up here, an' you ought to
see the queer look he gave me.
</p>

<p>
"'I'm not sure that I'll go back to the States,' he
said, 'it all depends; besides,' says he, 'my boy and girl
like this place and the people and I reckon I've got enough
money to live wherever I like.'
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'll put the roan in the stable, Tom; then I'll
mosey 'cross home and get my men at the cider-makin'.
A few frosts like last night's, an' all the apples will be
soured.  See you tonight at prayer-meetin'."
</p>

<p>
Wilson picked up his pails and carried them to the
fence.  Seeing Billy emerge from the house he placed
them on the top step of the stile and waited.
</p>

<p>
"Have a good time last night?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
Billy grinned, "You bet!  I tell you Ma kin certainly
roast partridge fine, an' say, can't old Harry play the
dandiest tune you ever heard?  Lou says he puts all the
songs of the wood-birds into one sweet warble."
</p>

<p>
"I guess whatever Lou says is jest about right, eh?"
</p>

<p>
Billy blushed to the roots of his hair but his grey eyes
met his father's steadily.  "Yep," he answered, "jest
about right."
</p>

<p>
Billy lifted the pails and turned up the path.
</p>

<p>
"Where have you put that man-eatin' swamp coon?"
asked his father as he followed.  "I believe he's gettin'
cross.  You'll have to watch him."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Ringdo ain't cross," laughed Billy, "he's only
playful.  He's over to Teacher Stanhope's.  He's so fond
of the teacher he won't stay away from him."
</p>

<p>
Billy set the pails down on the block outside the
milk-house and rubbed his cheek against Croaker, who had just
alighted on his shoulder.  "Are you goin' to show me
where you found the gold-pieces, Croaker?" he asked,
stroking the ruffled plumage smooth.
</p>

<p>
Croaker shooked his head and hopped to the ground.
He had grown tired of having Billy put that question to
him.  With many throaty and indignant mutterings he
pigeontoed across the yard, not even deigning to glance
back at the laughing man and boy.
</p>

<p>
"Pa," said Billy, "would you mind comin' to the
woodshed an' lookin' over my open water decoys.  I've
been restringin' 'em, an' weightin' the canvasbacks an'
redheads, an' givin' the bluebills a fresh coat o' paint.
I'd like to know what you think of my job."
</p>

<p>
"I heard you and Frank Stanhope arrangin' to go after
bay ducks t'other day," said Wilson as he followed Billy
into the shed.
</p>

<p>
"Yep, we're goin' tomorrow if this weather holds.  I'll
go over this afternoon to fix up a hide on Mud point."
</p>

<p>
"You seem to have managed the stringin' all right,"
said the father, examining the wooden ducks on the work
bench.  "A little too much white on the bluebills, I'd say."
</p>

<p>
"That's jest what I thought," said Billy.  "I'll darken
it some."
</p>

<p>
Wilson leaned against the bench and waited.  He knew
that Billy had brought him into the shed to speak of other
things than decoys.
</p>

<p>
"Pa," said the boy, in guarded tones, "you best watch
that man Hinter, an' watch him close."
</p>

<p>
"Why?" said Wilson.
</p>

<p>
"Cause he's up to some game, an' I know it."
</p>

<p>
"But what makes you suspicious of Hinter?" asked his
father gravely.  "Hasn't he always minded his own
business and been a law-abidin', quiet livin man?"
</p>

<p>
"Yep," Billy admitted, slowly, "that's it.  He's all
right in lots of ways, but in other ways&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He paused.  "See here, Pa," he cried, "I happen to
know one er two things about Hinter that I don't like.  He's
the boss of at least two bad men, an' I guess maybe there's
more in the gang, too."
</p>

<p>
"And who are these two men?  What have they done?"
</p>

<p>
"They're the two who've been workin' his drillin' rig;
an' they're the men that robbed the Twin Oaks store."
</p>

<p>
"How do you know this?" Wilson asked sharply.
</p>

<p>
"I know it 'cause Maurice an' me saw 'em on the very
night the store was robbed, out in Scroggie's woods.  They
had a lantern.  We heard 'em speak about hidin'
somethin' in the ha'nted house."
</p>

<p>
"And that's where Harry found the stolen stuff,"
mused Wilson.  "What else, Billy?"
</p>

<p>
"It was them two who brought Hinter's drillin'-rig
'cross the lake in a schooner.  I saw 'em the day they
teamed it in.  I knowed 'em both an' Pa, I overheard 'em
talkin' 'bout hidin' the stolen stuff in the ha'nted house."
</p>

<p>
"Have you told anybody else about this besides me,
Billy?"
</p>

<p>
"No," answered Billy, promptly, "not even Teacher
Stanhope."
</p>

<p>
Wilson looked relieved.  "I can't make head er tail
of it," he said, frowning.  "I can't think that Hinter is
behind the men in any deviltry."
</p>

<p>
"His name ain't Hinter," said Billy.  "It's Jacobs."
</p>

<p>
"What?"
</p>

<p>
"It's Jacobs.  Listen, Pa, I'll tell you how I know.
Anse, you remember, was sort of helper with them drillers
till he got askin' too many questions an' they fired
him.  Well, all he asked 'em, <i>I put him up to ask</i>.  Anse
was always a mighty good listener an' he often heard
these two, Jack and Tom, speak of Jacobs an' call him
boss.  An' one day when Hinter comes over, Anse heard
one of 'em call him Jacobs, an' Hinter was awful mad
about it."
</p>

<p>
"Well!" was all Wilson could say, and he repeated
it to himself several times, dazedly.
</p>

<p>
Billy was watching him closely.  "Pa," he said earnestly,
"there's something else I might as well let you
know while I'm about it.  This man Hinter owns a
schooner, er leastways is boss of one, an' it was her
brought them drillin' rigs 'cross the lake.  The boat's
been layin' along the Point, a mile out from shore fer
more'n a month now, an' Hinter has been keepin' in
touch with her right along."
</p>

<p>
"But how do you know this?" asked Wilson in
amazement.  Billy hesitated before answering.  "I know
it," he said, "'cause every night that he rides to the
lighthouse Maurice an' me sail up there an' sort o' hide
up till he leaves."
</p>

<p>
"But why, Billy?"
</p>

<p>
"'Cause he&mdash;he wants Erie," said the boy, miserably,
"an she won't marry him.  We've wondered why he's
been holdin' the schooner close in.  So we been watchin'
Hinter.  An' one night we follered him down the bar
to the pines, an' we seen him signal the schooner.  He
built a little fire on the shore.
</p>

<p>
"After a little we saw a light 'way out on the lake.  It
stayed where it was an by an' by we heard oars.  A boat
landed an' a man Hinter called Cap'n, came across to
where he sat by the fire."
</p>

<p>
"And did you hear anythin' of what passed between
'em, Billy?"
</p>

<p>
"Yep, we heard Hinter say Scroggie was a headstrong
fool, an' he wished he'd never had anythin' to do with
him; but that he'd have to handle him with gloves till he
got Lost Man's Swamp away from him."
</p>

<p>
Wilson whistled.  "What in the world does he want
with that swamp, I wonder?" he cried.
</p>

<p>
He stood considering.  "We'll just keep what we know
to ourselves till we're quite sure," he said at length.  "What
d'ye say?"
</p>

<p>
Billy nodded.  "That's what Trigger Finger 'ud do,"
he said, "an' Trigger Finger, he was always right, Pa."

CHAPTER XXIV
<br /><br />
BILLY TO THE RESCUE
</h3>

<p>
Nature had crooked a wooded arm about Rond Eau
Bay so that her tranquillity seldom was disturbed by the
fall gales which piled the waters of Lake Erie high and
made her a veritable death-trap for late-sailing ships.  To
the thunder of heavy waves upon the pine-clad beach the
little bay slept sweetly, while half a league beyond the
bar a tempest-torn, dismasted schooner might be battered
to pieces, or a heavy freighter, her back broken by the
twisting seas, might sink to final rest.  But there were
times when Rond Eau awoke from her dreaming to gnash
her white teeth and throw her hissing challenge to man
to dare ride her banked-up seas in open boat.  At such
times only the foolish or venturesome listened.  When the
gale swept in from the East it transformed the upper
waters into a seething cauldron, while, plunging in the
nine-mile sweep from the West, it swept water at the
foot, frothing and turbulent, across the rushlands.
</p>

<p>
At such times expert indeed must be the hand that
guides the frail skiff through those treacherous seas.  But
the slim punt which rounded Mud Point betwixt the
darkness and the dawn, in the teeth of an all night gale,
was propelled by one who knew every whimsical mood
of Rond Eau.  Now high on frothy comber, now lost
to view between the waves, the little craft beat onward,
a speck of driftwood on the angry waves.  Sullen
daylight was revealing a world of wind-whipped,
spray-drenched desolation when the punt at last rounded the
point and swept into the comparative calm of the lee
shore.  Then the rower shipped his oars and glanced at
his companion who sat huddled low in the bow of the
boat, the collar of his shooting coat turned high about
his ears.
</p>

<p>
"Phew! teacher, some pull, that!  Must'a been half
an hour beatin' up from Levee."
</p>

<p>
"It seemed longer than that to me, Billy," laughed
Stanhope.  "Once or twice I thought we were goners, but
you pulled the old girl through nobly."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know as I ever put her through a rougher
sea," said Billy as he began placing the decoys.  "We'll
get set, then we'll push into the rushes, hide our boat,
an' settle down comfortable in our blind.  You'll find it
warm, an' snug, an' wind-proof as a rat house, soon's I
get a fire started in the little stove.  Hello!" as a brown
shaggy head poked itself from beneath the seat and a
cold nose touched his wrist, "did you think I didn't know
you was there, Moll?"
</p>

<p>
Moll whined and wagged her stub of a tail, undoubtedly
sensing from her master's words and manner that her
offense, in "sneakin' in," had been pardoned.  Five
minutes later they were seated snugly inside four walls of
tightly woven rushes, the blind man's face alive and
glowing with the joy of once more feeling the moist kiss
of open water, his ears atuned for the first whistle of
incoming wings.  Billy crouched by his side, gun in
hand, eyes sweeping the lighting bay.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the spaniel's tail commenced beating a soft
tattoo on the rush floor and Billy's grip tightened on the
walnut stock.
</p>

<p>
"How many?" whispered Stanhope.
</p>

<p>
"Five, bluebill.  Comin' right to us."
</p>

<p>
A moment later the "swowee" of the cutting wings
sounded, close in, and the old gun spoke twice.
</p>

<p>
"Two down," cried Stanhope.  "Good work, Billy!"
</p>

<p>
Billy took his eyes from the pair of dead ducks, floating
shoreward and turned wonderingly to his companion.
</p>

<p>
"Teacher," he said in awed tones, "sometimes I'm sure
you kin see.  If you can't see how do you find out things
like you do?  How did you know I killed jest two ducks?"
</p>

<p>
"Listened for the splash," Stanhope answered.  "Are
you loaded, Billy?  There's another flock coming."
</p>

<p>
"All ready but cappin'.  Now, where's the flock?"
</p>

<p>
"Coming up from behind, so Moll says."
</p>

<p>
"Gosh!" whispered Billy.  "I should say so; they're
right onto us," and almost with the words the old gun
roared again and again.
</p>

<p>
"Good!" exulted Stanhope.  "Three down, Billy!"
</p>

<p>
"Yep, but one dived an' is gettin' away.  After him,
Moll."  The spaniel, with a joyful whine, cleared the rush
wall and splashed into the water.  "Fine!" cried Billy,
as he reloaded, "Moll's goin' to bring him in."
</p>

<p>
"Wounded whistlers aren't as hard to retrieve as
redhead or bluebill," said Stanhope.
</p>

<p>
"How did you know they was whistlers?" cried Billy.
</p>

<p>
"By the sound of their wings, of course," laughed the
man.  "There," as a small duck flashed past the blind,
"that's a green-winged teal, and he's flying at the rate of
about ninety miles an hour."
</p>

<p>
Eastward the leaden clouds opened to let an arrow of
orange light pierce the damp mists of dawn; then the
fissure closed again and tardy daylight disclosed only a
dun-colored waste of cowering rushes and tossing water.
Far out in the bay a great flock of ducks arose, the beat
of their wings growing up above the boom of the wind,
stood black against the lowering skies an instant, then
swept like a gigantic shadow close down above the curling
water.  Here and there detached fragments of the flock
grew up and drifted shoreward.  A flock of widgeon,
gleaming snow-white against the clouds as they swerved in
toward the decoys, were joined by a pair of kingly
canvasbacks.  Swiftly they approached, twisted aside just out
of range, and then turned and came in with wings set
against the wind.
</p>

<p>
Stanhope heard the splash of their bodies, as they lit
among the decoys.  He wondered why Billy did not shoot.
A tense moment passed and still the old gun gave no voice.
Moll was whining low and eagerly.  Then, suddenly, there
arose the sound of webbed feet slapping water, strong wings
lifted to the wind, and Stanhope knew that the ducks had
gone.
</p>

<p>
"Billy!" he cried, "why didn't you shoot?"
</p>

<p>
"I guess I didn't think about it," said the boy.
"There's a boat out yonder, an' she's havin' trouble.  I was
watchin' her."
</p>

<p>
"A boat in trouble?  Where is she?"
</p>

<p>
"Out in the middle of the bay.  There's two men in
her; she must be shippin' water, 'cause she's low down.
She's one of Swanson's boats.  He ought'a know better
than let a couple of greenies out on that sea."
</p>

<p>
Billy had thrown off his shooting-coat and was climbing
out of the blind.
</p>

<p>
"What are you going to do?" asked Stanhope.
</p>

<p>
"Goin' out to give a hand," shouted Billy.  "No,
teacher, you best stay right here; you can't help me any
an' I may have to bring them two shooters ashore in the
punt."
</p>

<p>
His last words were drowned in the wind.  Already he
was dragging the punt from the reeds.  A moment later
Stanhope heard the dip of his oars as he rounded the point
and put the tiny craft into the seas and his cheerful hail,
"I'll be back soon, teacher."
</p>

<p>
With broadening day the gale had strengthened.  Stanhope
felt a few stinging snow-pellets on his face, as he
gazed, unseeing, outward and waited with tense nerves for
the hail of his young friend.  Half an hour passed&mdash;it
seemed like hours to the man waiting, hoping, fearing&mdash;and
still Billy did not come.  He replenished the fire and,
his hand coming in contact with the coat which Billy had
discarded, he held it on his knees, close to the little stove.
Slowly the minutes dragged past and a cold dread of what
might have happened grew in the blind man's heart.  Billy
had likely reached the boat only in time to see it founder
and in striving to save its exhausted occupants&mdash;&mdash;.
</p>

<p>
Unable to endure the thought Stanhope sprang to his
feet and lifting his arms high shouted with all his strength,
"Billy, Billy boy!"
</p>

<p>
"Ho, teacher!" came an answering voice.  "We're
comin' straight in with the wind.  I've got 'em both."
</p>

<p>
Stanhope sank back on his box, his relaxed nerves
throbbing and his lips forming the words: "Thank God!"
</p>

<p>
A few minutes later Billy tumbled into the blind.
"Quick," he cried, as he drew on his coat.  "They're
nigh done fer.  We've gotta keep 'em movin'.  Good!  I
see you've heated the tea; I'll jest take it along.  We'll
leave gun an' decoys right here with Moll to watch 'em,
'cause we're likely to have our hands full.  Are you ready,
teacher?"
</p>

<p>
"All set," cried Stanhope.  "Leave your belt loose so
I can hang to it and I'm with you.  That's right.  Who
were they, Billy?"
</p>

<p>
"Couple of shooters from Cleveland.  One of 'em's a
big, strong feller, an' he ain't as near done up as the
other.  I started 'em to shore along the rush-track.
They'll be all hunky so long as they keep goin'.  We
best get 'em to the nearest house."
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's my place," answered Stanhope.  "How
am I navigating, Billy?"
</p>

<p>
"Fine; keepin' up as well as though you saw right
where you're goin'.  They're only a little ahead now."
</p>

<p>
As the wooded shore was reached they came up with the
rescued men.  Billy passed the chilled and wretched two
the hot tea and after they had drunk he and Stanhope
took the lead through the stumpy fields.
</p>

<p>
Half an hour later, seated about the roaring fire in
Stanhope's cottage, huge cups of hot coffee on their knees,
the venturesome strangers seemed none the worse for their
trying experience.  The larger of the two, a powerfully-built
man with pleasant clean shaven face and keen blue
eyes, turned now to Stanhope.
</p>

<p>
"Where did the boy go?" he asked.  "He must have
been wet to the skin."
</p>

<p>
"He went back to take up the decoys and bring in the
boats," answered Stanhope.  "Oh, Billy's used to
roughing it.  He'll be back directly."
</p>

<p>
"By George!" cried the big man, slapping his friend's
knee.  "There's a boy for you, Doctor.  Why, sir,"
addressing Stanhope, "not one youngster in a thousand could
have done what he did.  When he came to us our boat
was all but swamped.  We had given up.  My friend here
was utterly helpless with the cold and I was little better.
And then he came riding close in like a mere straw on the
waves and something flashed past me and fell with a bump
against our boat-seat.  'Bale,' he screeched, and I picked
up the can he had thrown us and bale I did for all I was
worth.  Then he came shooting back.  'You got to get out
of that trough,' he shouted.  'Throw your painter loose,
so's I can grab it as I pass, and I'll straighten your bow
to take the seas.'"
</p>

<p>
The speaker paused, his face aglow.  "I managed to cast
that painter loose and the boy caught it as he shot past us.
Then I felt the skiff straighten and I heard him shout
again, 'Bale! bale like fury!'  So I baled and baled and
by and by we shipped less water than I managed to throw
out.  All this time that youngster was hauling us in to
safety.  I don't know who the boy is, but let me tell you
this, my friend, if I was his daddy I'd be the proudest
man on the face of the earth."
</p>

<p>
His companion, a slight, stooped man, the sallowness of
whose face was accentuated by a short black moustache, who
had remained almost silent from the time he had entered
the house, looked up at these words and smiled.  "We
owe that boy and this gentleman our lives," he said briefly.
</p>

<p>
The big man laid a hand on Stanhope's arm.  "My good
friend," he said, "will you allow me to introduce you to
the grateful chaps you have helped save.  This gentleman
with me is the famous specialist, Doctor Cavinalt of
Cleveland; and yours truly is plain Bill Maddoc of the same
city, lawyer by profession."
</p>

<p>
"My friend has forgotten to mention that he is state's
attorney and a noted bugbear to all evil-doers," smiled
the doctor.  "In other words he's known as Trail Down
Maddoc and&mdash;if he will permit of my so stating&mdash;is far
more famous in his own particular line than am I in mine."
</p>

<p>
"Tut, tut," cried Maddoc, "what matter such trifles as
these at this time?  And now," turning to their host, "if
you will honor us?"
</p>

<p>
"My name is Stanhope; Frank Stanhope."
</p>

<p>
"What?"  The lawyer was on his feet and had his
hands on Frank's shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"You say Stanhope?  Why, man alive!  I've been looking
high and low for you.  What do you think of that,
Doctor, I've found him at last!"
</p>

<p>
"Young man," said Maddoc, turning again to Frank,
"will you please answer a few questions?  Did you ever
know a queer old man by the name of Scroggie?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, yes," Frank answered, somewhat puzzled.  "He
lived next farm to me."
</p>

<p>
"And," Maddoc resumed, "do you happen to know
that he made a will, leaving all he possessed to you?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir, so he said; but the will was never found."
</p>

<p>
"And for a very good reason, by George," cried Maddoc.
"How could it be found when it lay safely locked
in a deposit box in my vault?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid I don't quite understand&mdash;" commenced
the amazed Stanhope.
</p>

<p>
"Of course not, how could you?" cried the lawyer.
"But there now, I'll explain.
</p>

<p>
"One morning something over a year ago a queer little
man came to my office.  He told me his name, Scroggie,
but refused to give me any address.  He said he wished
to make his will and insisted that I draw it up.  It was
a simple will, as I remember it, merely stating that 'I
something-or-other, Scroggie, hereby bequeath all my
belongings, including land and money, to Frank Stanhope.'  I
made it out exactly as he worded it, had it sealed
and witnessed and handed it to him.  But the old fellow
refused to take it.  I asked him why, and he said: 'You
keep it safe until I send for it.  I'm willin' to pay for your
trouble.'
</p>

<p>
"'But listen, old man,' I said, 'supposing you should
die suddenly.  Life is very uncertain, you know.  This will
should be left where it can be easily found, don't you see?"
</p>

<p>
"'That's just where I don't want it left,' he says.  'I
want it kept safe.  I'll take a chance on dying suddenly.'  And
by George! the old fellow got up and shambled out,
leaving a twenty-dollar gold piece on the table."
</p>

<p>
"Then," said Frank, moistening his dry lips, "you
have the will, Mr. Maddoc?"
</p>

<p>
"I have!" cried the delighted lawyer, "and whether he
left you much or little nobody can dispute your claim.
Young man, shake hands again!"
</p>

<p>
But Stanhope had sunk on a chair, his face in his hands.
Doctor Cavinalt went softly over and stood beside him.
"My friend," he said gently, "good news often bowls
us over, but perhaps there's even better news in store for
you.  Fortune is a good thing, but with fortune and your
eye-sight restored&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Frank lifted a wan face.  "You mean&mdash;&mdash;?" his dry
lips formed the words.
</p>

<p>
The slender sensitive fingers of the specialist lifted the
lids of the unseeing eyes.  Intently he examined them,
then with a quick smile that transformed his grave face to
almost boyish gladness, he spoke.
</p>

<p>
"It is as I thought, Mr. Stanhope.  Your sight is quite
unimpaired and can be restored to you by a simple operation.
Your blindness was caused either from a blow or a
fall, was it not?"
</p>

<p>
Frank nodded.  "A beam struck me," he whispered, "I
thought&mdash;I thought&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Tomorrow," said the doctor, retiring once more into
his professional shell, "I shall remove the pressure that
obstructs your vision.  The operation, which will be most
simple, can be performed here.  We have but to remove
all pressure on the nerve centres that refuse their
function now&mdash;and you will see."
</p>

<p>
He motioned to his friend, and the two went over to the
window and talked together in low tones.
</p>

<p>
Stanhope, hands clasped together, sat staring into a vista
of shadows that were all but dissolved.  Above them lifted
a face that smiled&mdash;and down across sleeping, darkening
waters a long ray of light swept to touch his unseeing eyes
and whisper her message of hope.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
It was nearly noon when Billy, bending beneath a load
of wild ducks, came up the path to the cottage.  Stanhope,
reading his step, groped his way out to meet him.  "Ho,
Billy Boy," he cried, holding out his hands.
</p>

<p>
Billy placed his wet, cold ones in Stanhope's.  "I
simply had to stay an' shoot," he explained.  "The ducks
were fair poundin' into the decoys.  How are the
Cleveland fellers?"
</p>

<p>
"Good as ever, Billy, dried out&mdash;and gone.  Come into
the house.  I've got great news."
</p>

<p>
Billy turned puzzled eyes on his friend, reading a
wonderful happiness in the glowing face.  He dropped his
ducks and followed Stanhope inside.  The table was set
for dinner and Billy sniffed hungrily.
</p>

<p>
"Now teacher," he said, dropping into a seat by the
fire, "give us the news."
</p>

<p>
But Stanhope shook his head.  "Not yet, Billy.  Wait
until you've eaten.  You're hungry&mdash;as all hunters are
bound to be.  There now," as his housekeeper brought in
the meat and potatoes, "sit down and eat&mdash;and eat fast,
because I can't keep my good news back much longer."
</p>

<p>
Billy sat down at the table and without a word fell to.
Stanhope stood beside the window, humming a tune, a
smile on his face.  He roused himself from his musing, as
Billy scraped back his chair.  "Full up?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Full up, teacher.  Now let's have the good news."
</p>

<p>
Stanhope told him, his voice not always steady, and
Billy sat silent, his grey eyes growing bigger and bigger.
And at the conclusion he did a very boyish thing.  He
lowered his head to the table and cried.
</p>

<p>
Stanhope groped his way to him, placed his hands gently
on the heaving shoulders, and there they remained until
Billy, with a long sigh, raised his swimming eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Teacher," he said.  "<i>She's</i> gotta be told about this.
You know how she always hoped&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
Billy stood up and reached for his cap.  "If Anse
comes over, you kin tell him where I've gone.  I'll be back
long afore dark."
</p>

<p>
"But, Billy, the wind!  You'd better not go."
</p>

<p>
"The wind's gone down," said the boy.  "Jest a fair
sailin' breeze now."
</p>

<p>
"She'll come, you think?"
</p>

<p>
"She'll come," said Billy, and went out, closing the
door softly behind him.

CHAPTER XXV
<br /><br />
MR. HINTER MAKES A CONFESSION
</h3>

<p>
It was the evening of the next day.  Frank Stanhope
lay on a couch in a darkened room, a black bandage across
his eyes.  Erie Landon sat beside him, holding his hand.
The pungent odor of ether hung in the air.  Out in the
dining room old Doctor Allworth, from Bridgetown, was
discussing with the specialist things known only to those
men of science.
</p>

<p>
Erie was very happy&mdash;happier than she had ever
expected to be again.  Doctor Cavinalt had pronounced
the operation a success; in a week or ten days the bandage
might be taken off.  God's world of light and beauty was
to be his again&mdash;and hers!
</p>

<p>
Stanhope felt the unconscious tightening of her fingers
and spoke her name ever so softly.  She gave a little,
contented sigh, and nestled her cool cheek against his own.
</p>

<p>
"I was dreaming of the foot of the Causeway," he
whispered, "and the light."
</p>

<p>
"And it reached straight across through the blackness
to you?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Straight to me, dear; and at the farther end of its
misty radiance I saw you standing.  You stretched your
dear arms out to me and along the shimmering track, drawn
by your great and tender woman's love, I sped to you."
</p>

<p>
"And found me, Frank?"
</p>

<p>
"Found you," he echoed joyfully.  "Found you as I
have prayed through lightless days I might, some day, find
you, blue-eyed girl with heart of gold; found you with your
hope, your loyalty, your tenderness and your forgiveness."
</p>

<p>
"And now," she whispered, "there lie the days of
sunshine and happiness ahead of us, Frank; and oh, how we
will enjoy them, you and I and Billy."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, we mustn't forget Billy, God bless him."
</p>

<p>
In the outer room the learned discussion was terminated
suddenly by a loud exclamation from the old doctor.
</p>

<p>
"God love us, it's a crow!" he cried, "and the rascal
has appropriated my glasses!  Laid 'em on my chair-arm
for an instant and the cheeky beggar swooped in through
the open window and picked 'em up."
</p>

<p>
"That's Croaker," laughed Erie.  "Billy won't be far
behind him.  I had better go out and explain things,
Frank."
</p>

<p>
She touched her warm lips to his and went into the
adjoining room to find Croaker perched on a curtain-pole,
animatedly congratulating himself on the new and
wonderful shiny thing he had been so fortunate as to
discover.
</p>

<p>
"Croaker," Erie called.  At the sound of her voice the
crow stopped trying to tear the nosepiece from the lens
and cocked his head side-wise.
</p>

<p>
"Kowakk," he gurgled, which meant "I thought I
knew you, Miss, but I guess I don't."
</p>

<p>
"Croaker, good old Croaker, come down and I'll get you
a cookie," Erie begged.
</p>

<p>
Croaker considered this last statement a moment.  Then
he carefully raised one foot and twisted half way around
on the bar.
</p>

<p>
"A cookie, a nice fat cookie, with a raisin in its
centre," coaxed the girl.
</p>

<p>
The crow lifted the other foot and with much fluttering
and complaining managed to get all the way around.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Burke had brought in a plate of cookies.  Erie took
one and held it up, as an enticement to Croaker.
</p>

<p>
"Want it?" she asked.  "Then come down and be a
good crow."
</p>

<p>
Then it was that Croaker, gripping the glasses in one
black claw, burst into a cry of joyful recognition.
</p>

<p>
Just at this juncture the shed door was nosed softly open
and a striped, furry animal rolled into the room like a
ball and, raising himself on his hind legs, took the cookie
from Erie's hand.
</p>

<p>
"Ringdo, you old sweetheart!" cried the girl and,
reaching for the big swamp-coon, gathered him into her
arms.
</p>

<p>
Doctor Allworth, after one startled look at the
ferocious-looking newcomer, had climbed upon the table and now
gazed wildly at the strange sight of a golden haired girl
holding to her bosom a wild animal which might be
anything from a wolf to a grizzly, for aught he knew.
</p>

<p>
At the sound of the girl's voice the swamp coon had
dropped the cookie, and as she swept him into her arms
his slender red tongue darted forth to give the curling
tress above her ear an affectionate caress.  Ringdo
recognized in Erie the playmate who used to romp with him
and stray with him along spongy moss and clayey ditches.
</p>

<p>
At this particular moment Croaker, from whom attention
had for the time being been diverted, came into evidence
again.  At first sight of his old enemy the crow had
grown rigid with anger; his black neck-ruff had stood up
like the feathers on an Indian warrior's head dress and
into his beady eyes had sprung the fighting-fire.  When
Ringdo got possession of the cookie he raised his short
wings and prepared to swoop, strike, and if luck held,
swoop again.  But when the coon dropped the cookie that
he might show the girl who had come back to the old
playground that he was glad Croaker promptly changed his
mind.  He swooped, but on the precious cookie instead of
on Ringdo, and with the prize in his black beak and the
glasses dangling from one black claw, he went out of the
open window like a dark streak.
</p>

<p>
The old doctor sighed dolefully.  "Well, my glasses
are gone," he murmured.  "And how I will ever do without
'em, I don't know."  Then, becoming suddenly aware
of his ridiculous position, he stepped ponderously down
from the table to his chair.
</p>

<p>
Hiding her laughing face in Ringdo's long fur, Erie
reassured him.  "Please, Doctor Allworth, don't be frightened
of this old coon," she said.  "Indeed, he is quite
harmless."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps so," returned the old gentleman dryly, "but,
you see, I happen to have heard an opinion of friend
Ringdo's gentle nature from a certain learned pedagogue,
whose wounds I dressed recently.  So, my dear young
lady, if you will be good enough to keep tight hold of him
for a moment, I'll follow my renowned friend into the
parlor and learn how Frank is coming along."  And
suiting the action to the words he edged slowly around the
table and, backing into the parlor, closed the door.
</p>

<p>
"Ringdo," cried Erie, slapping the coon's fat sides,
"you can't possibly see your friend, Frank, now so come
along.  We'll have a race down the path and a scramble
among the leaves."
</p>

<p>
She caught her hat from a peg, opened the door, and
Ringdo gamboled out before her.  Down the path to the
gate they sped and out into the tree-hedged road.  Already
the frost-pinched leaves, crimson-veined and golden, were
being swung to earth by a soft wind that promised snow.
With Ringdo galloping clumsily beside her Erie went
down the road, trilling a snatch of a song.
</p>

<p>
She did not realize what a perfect picture she presented,
with her golden hair wind-strewn, her red lips parted, and
the old joy singing in her heart and kindling a light in
her eyes.  But the boy who met her at the curve in the road
realized it, and his face grew wistful as he asked: "Is he
all right, Erie?"
</p>

<p>
"He is all right, Billy," she answered softly.
</p>

<p>
Billy's grey eyes grew big with realization and a long
sigh escaped his lips.  He bent above the coon, who had
sprawled in the dust, all four feet in the air, inviting a
tussle.  The girl saw something glitter and splash on the
dark fur and her throat tightened.  "Oh Billy, Billy,"
she choked, and with all the abandon of her nature stooped
and gathered boy and animal close to her.
</p>

<p>
A little later they went back up the road, side by side.
Ringdo having heard the call of the forest-creek had
strayed into the tangle, perhaps hoping to find a fat frog
which had not yet sought its winter sleeping-bog.  They
paused to watch a red squirrel flash along the zig-zag fence
and halt, with twitching tail, as the chatter of the black
he was pursuing came down to him from swaying hickory
tree-top.  High overhead a flock of crows passed silently,
black hurtling bodies seeming to brush the grey, low
hanging skies as they melted into distance.  High above, the
shrill whistle of wings told of wild ducks seeking the
marshes and the celery beds of the bay.
</p>

<p>
"Erie," spoke the boy as they turned to resume their
way, "Ma told me to tell you that she'd be over ag'in
tonight to stay with you.  She's had an awful time keepin'
teacher's friends from swarmin' over to see how he was
gettin' along an' she says she simply had to promise that
they could come over after supper.  I guess the whole
Settlement is over to our place.  I better lope along an'
tell 'em the good news."  He turned away as they reached
the gate&mdash;then hesitated.
</p>

<p>
"Anything I can tell him, Billy?" asked Erie, noticing
his reluctance.
</p>

<p>
"No, but there's somethin' I ought'a tell you, I guess,"
he answered.  "I've jest come from old Swanson's boardin'
house, at the foot.  Mr. Maddoc an' the specialist
doctor are goin' to leave there an' stay at teacher's, as you
likely know?"
</p>

<p>
Erie nodded.  "They told me all about it.  How they
are going to shoot from your Mud Point, and how good it
was of you to let them," she smiled.
</p>

<p>
Billy grinned.  "Say!" he murmured, "as if there
was anythin' any of us wouldn't do fer them now.  Well,
Mr. Maddoc, who's havin' Joe Scraff drive down fer their
stuff tonight, was comin' along up with me when we met
Hinter, 'bout a mile back on the road."
</p>

<p>
He paused and searched the girl's face.  "You see,
Erie," he said slowly, "I'd been tellin' Mr. Maddoc all
about how Hinter an' Scroggie had been tryin' to find
water fer us, an' how they had had a barrel of oil explode,
an' every thin'.  Somehow he didn't seem a bit like a
stranger.  I didn't mind tellin' him at all.  Why, I even
told him about the Twin Oaks store robbery, an' about
Hinter wantin' to get hold of Lost Man's Swamp, an'
everythin'.
</p>

<p>
"He was awful interested, an' asked me to show him
the fenced-in well.  So we took 'cross the fields an' he saw
it.  He went all around the walls an' even climbed up one
side of 'em, an' looked over.  When he came down he said:
'Jest as I thought, Billy.  That explosion you spoke of
was a charge of nitro glycerine.'  We struck back fer the
road an' I guess he was thinkin' hard, 'cause he didn't
talk any more.  Then, as we was climbin' the fence to the
road he asks: 'What kind of a chap is this man, Hinter,
Billy?"
</p>

<p>
"'Why,' I says, 'there he is now.'  Hinter had jest
climbed the opposite fence an' stepped into the road.
Mr. Maddoc slid down an' went right up to him.  Hinter's
face turned white when he saw Mr. Maddoc.  He couldn't
speak fer a minute, an' then all he did was mumble
somethin'.
</p>

<p>
"'Billy,' Mr. Maddoc says to me, 'would you go on a
piece an' leave me alone with this man.  You see we've
met before an' I want'a ask him some questions.'
</p>

<p>
"So I come on an' I guess Mr. Maddoc had a whole lot
of questions to ask fer he ain't come yet."
</p>

<p>
Erie was standing against the gate, her arms stretched
along its top, hands clenching its rough pickets.
</p>

<p>
"There, he's coming now, Billy," she whispered, as the
lawyer's tall form swung about the curve in the road.
"No, don't go yet; perhaps he will have something more
to tell us."
</p>

<p>
But the lawyer, apparently, had nothing to tell them.
Gravely he lifted his hat to Erie, threw a smile of
good-fellowship to Billy and turned up the path to the cottage.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
No sooner had Billy gone, leaving Maddoc alone with
Hinter, than the lawyer's manner underwent a lightning
change.  His big face lost its jovial look and the bushy
eyebrows contracted to sinister juts on his puckered brow,
as the cold eyes beneath them probed the man before him.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Jacobs&mdash;or whatever your name happens to be
now&mdash;what are you doing here?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
Hinter, with an effort, shook off his first cringing fear.
"Supposing I tell you that it's none of your business,
Mr. Maddoc," he said, with a poor attempt at bluff.  "I am
not under your jurisdiction here."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, is that so?  Well, my smooth friend, you're liable
to learn that my jurisdiction extends further than you
think.  Now see here, Jacobs.  You know&mdash;and I know&mdash;that
I have enough on you already to put you away where
you'll do little harm for several years to come.  Do you
want me to do it?"
</p>

<p>
"No."  The man's answer was nothing more than a
spiritless murmur.  Maddoc, he knew, had his record and
had spoken truly when he said he had the goods on him.
"No," he repeated with a shudder.
</p>

<p>
"Then come clean, Jacobs.  Now then, what's your game?"
</p>

<p>
"I came here after you drove me from the Pennsylvania
oil fields," said the other, realizing the uselessness
of lying.
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
"To prospect; to look for a new field.  I figured that
the Pennsylvania vein would come out about here and
extend northward."
</p>

<p>
"Sounds reasonable.  And you still think so, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Is that your well with the jail-wall about it, yonder?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I bored it but it belongs to Pennsylvania Scroggie,
the man whom you helped defeat the Southern lease ring."
</p>

<p>
If Maddoc was surprised, he did not show it.  "You
struck oil, I see, Jacobs."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, about an eight-a-day well."
</p>

<p>
"Deep?"
</p>

<p>
"No, surface."
</p>

<p>
"And Scroggie&mdash;does he know your record?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not.  Oh for God's sake stop probing me
this way.  I'm willing to tell all there is to tell."
</p>

<p>
"That suits me, Jacobs.  Go on."
</p>

<p>
"As I say, I came here to prospect.  I found plenty of
surface evidence of oil and gas but without capital I was
helpless.  I learned that a thousand-acre tract of woods,
rich in oil indications, was owned by Pennsylvania Scroggie.
I knew that he was a hog and that if I showed my hand
too clearly he would kick me under and go it alone.
Through a friend who owned a lake schooner I made
Scroggie a proposition.  I guaranteed to show him a virgin
oil territory and operate his rigs for a certain percentage
of the output.  This he agreed to.  Then he came and when
he found that the vein lay on his own land he was furious
and tried to break the contract.
</p>

<p>
"I had anticipated his doing something like this and
had provided against it.  Old man Scroggie, the original
owner of this land, had left a will, bequeathing all he
owned to a young man of this district, Stanhope by name.
Scroggie, I knew, was afraid of the will coming to light
and I worked on this fear.  It was known throughout
this community that the one friend old Scroggie had
trusted was Spencer, the store-keeper, who, having
quarreled with the elder Stanhope over a survey of property,
held a secret grudge against his son, Frank."
</p>

<p>
"And," said the lawyer as Jacobs paused to wipe his
beaded brow, "you thought the will lay in Spencer's safe,
and that he was holding it away because of petty malice?"
</p>

<p>
"Exactly."
</p>

<p>
"And knowing that in spite of his many short-comings
Pennsylvania Scroggie wouldn't deliberately rob young
Stanhope of the property, providing he knew for sure that
his uncle had made the young man his heir, you made up
your mind to blow Spencer's safe and get hold of the will
yourself&mdash;supposing it was there, and so make sure of
your own little rake-off."
</p>

<p>
Jacobs gazed at the lawyer wonderingly.  "How did
you know?" he stammered.
</p>

<p>
"I know, Jacobs, that you and your henchmen, Tom
Standish and Jack Blake, robbed Twin Oaks store and
blew the safe; also that you were disappointed.  There
was no will there.  Where you made your big mistake, my
friend, was in misjudging Pennsylvania Scroggie.  For
instance, when you lied to him and told him that you had
found the will, and threatened to turn it over to the
rightful heir, providing he did not give you a clear deed to
Lost Man's Swamp&mdash;what did he say to you?"
</p>

<p>
The question stung the other as a leather lash stings
quivering flesh.
</p>

<p>
"What did he say to you?" repeated the lawyer, and
the wretched man on the rack answered hopelessly: "He
told me that if I didn't give the will up to Stanhope he
would have me arrested and sent to the pen."
</p>

<p>
A little smile curled the corners of Maddoc's stern
mouth.  "Well, that's Pennsylvania Scroggie," he said,
as though to himself.  "Hard, bull-headed and a sharper
in every legitimate sense but square as they make 'em.
And you," he asked, pointedly, "what did you do?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course I had to own up that I had lied.  He had
me down on my knees all right, but I was valuable to him
right then.  We had started boring on his land.  He said
that he would give me another chance but that I would
have to keep honest."
</p>

<p>
The man who had the reputation of being able to read
criminals unerringly glanced keenly at the man's face.
</p>

<p>
"And you've found the condition too difficult; isn't
that so?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"No, Mr. Maddoc, as God is my witness, I was keeping
honest and intended to go on."  Jacobs had drawn his
drooping form erect, and now spoke with a certain dignity.
</p>

<p>
Maddoc was silent for a moment.  Then his square chin
shot forward.
</p>

<p>
"Jacobs," he said, crisply, "I'll give you twenty-four
hours in which to lose yourself.  You can't stay here."
</p>

<p>
Something like a sigh escaped the man who listened to
this edict.  He took a lagging step or two forward.
</p>

<p>
"Wait," said the lawyer.  "Tell me, Jacobs, is there
anything in this world you care for outside of yourself
and your ambition to climb to fortune over the necks of
others?  I'm curious to know."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," answered the other, without hesitation.  "There
is something; there are dogs and children."
</p>

<p>
"Dogs and children," repeated the lawyer.  "Dogs and
children."  He stood looking away through the failing
light to where a strip of mauve-lined sky peeked through
the heavy tissue of cloud.
</p>

<p>
"And what do dogs and children think of you?" he
asked, abruptly.
</p>

<p>
"Both trust me," said Jacobs simply and Maddoc knew
that he spoke the truth.  He strode across and put his
hands on the shoulders of the man from whom he had
wrung confession.
</p>

<p>
"Listen!" he said harshly.  "You know me and you
know I don't often give a man like you more than a
second chance.  You have had your second chance and failed.
But see here, I'm not infallible.  If dogs and children
trust you there must be some good in you, and by George!
I'm going to do something which is either going to prove
the biggest piece of damn foolishness or the biggest coup
I have ever pulled off in my life.  I'm going to take my
grip from your throat, Jacobs, and leave you to the dogs
and the children.
</p>

<p>
"Now, here's some news for you.  The will has been
found and Frank Stanhope is heir to the Scroggie forest-lands.
But if there is oil here&mdash;and there is&mdash;both you
and Pennsylvania Scroggie will be needed.  I have no
doubt but a satisfactory arrangement on a share producing
plan can be made with the owner of the land.  I'll see
Pennsylvania Scroggie tonight and he'll do what I ask.  I
pulled him out of a rather tight hole and I guess he won't
have forgotten.  Come over to Stanhope's cottage in the
morning.  Now remember what the children and dogs
expect of you, my friend; good-bye until tomorrow."
</p>

<p>
He smiled and held out his hand.  The other man took
it dazedly, then slowly and with head lifted towards the
darkening skies, he passed down the road.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVI
<br /><br />
A GOLDEN WEDDING GIFT
</h3>

<p>
Bad news travels fast but good news wings its way quite
as speedily.  Life teaches the human heart to accept the
one bravely and to laugh happily with the other, for after
all life is just a ringing note that sounds through and
above the eternal weaving of God's shuttle&mdash;at times
clear, reaching to the highest stars; at other times a minor
wail of pain.  But the weaving goes on, drab threads
mingling with the brighter ones; and so the heart learns
to withstand, and better still to hope.  It may be, when
the shuttle runs slower and the fabric is all but woven, if
the weaver is brave and strong he is able to decipher the
riddle of it all.  "If you would experience happiness, find
it in the happiness of others."
</p>

<p>
Now the unrest and uncertainty which had overshadowed
Scotia for months had been miraculously lifted and in its
place was rest and certainty.  Sorrow and pity for the
man who had been stricken with blindness gave place to
joy and congratulation.  Swifter-winged than the harbinger
of sorrow, which sometimes falters in its flight as
though loath to cause a jarring note deep within God's
harmony, flashed the joyful news that Frank Stanhope
had come into his inheritance and would see again.  For
a week following the wonderful news the people of the
Settlement did little else than discuss it together.  Man,
woman and child they came to the vine-covered cottage to
tell Stanhope they were glad.
</p>

<p>
Pennsylvania Scroggie had been one of the first to offer
his congratulations.  "Young man," he said to Stanhope,
"I'm some rough on the outside but I reckon I'm all
right inside.  You've got your sight back and you've got,
in this fine piece of land my old uncle left you, what
promises to be a real oil field.  Hinter and I are going to
develop it for you, if you've no objections.  And you've
got a whole lot more than that," glancing at Erie, who
stood near.  And Stanhope, sensing the sterling worth of
the man, shook hands gladly.
</p>

<p>
Lawyer Maddoc and Doctor Cavinalt had gone back to
Cleveland, promising to return every fall so long as their
welcome held out and Billy was there to guide them about
and save their lives, if necessary.
</p>

<p>
Old Harry O'Dule's dream was about to be realised,
Stanhope had assured him that he would see to it that he
should play his whistle beneath Ireland's skies before
another autumn dawned.
</p>

<p>
It was a world of silence, a world bathed in golden haze,
that Stanhope gazed upon with the restoration of his
sight.  A long time his eyes dwelt upon the vista before
him, with its naked trees piercing the mauve-line of
morning mist shimmering above the yellow wood-smoke.
The girl beside him knew from the tightening hand on hers
and the awe that paled his quivering face that the silence
spoke a thankfulness which mere words could never
express.  So she waited, and after a long time he turned
slowly and holding her at arm's length, smiled down into
her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"And you, too," he whispered.  "With all this, I have
you, too."
</p>

<p>
"You know that you have always had me, Prank," ahe
said softly.
</p>

<p>
"But more than ever I want you now; more than ever
I need you.  Erie," he said earnestly, "are you willing
to marry me right away&mdash;next week?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh Frank&mdash;" she began, but he checked her utterance
with his lips.
</p>

<p>
"The Reverend Reddick is available at any day, any
hour, Lighthouse girl; he's conducting revival services in
the Valley church.  It will all be so simple.  Won't you
say next week?"
</p>

<p>
She gazed into his radiant face with serious eyes.  "But
Frank," she whispered, "it may be cold and dismal next
week, I&mdash;I always thought that I should like our wedding
to be&mdash;-"
</p>

<p>
Her head went down to hide against his arm.
</p>

<p>
"Go on, Lighthouse girl.  You always thought you
would like our wedding to be&mdash;when?"
</p>

<p>
"On a golden, Indian summer day like this," she
finished and closed her eyes as his arms went about her.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
"And ut's married they were this mornin', whilst the
dew still clung to the mosses, and ut's meself was witness
to the j'inin' av two av the tinderest hearts in all the
wurruld."  Old Harry O'Dule, on his rounds to spread
the joyful tidings of Frank and Erie's marriage, had met
Billy leading a fat bay horse along a sun-streaked forest
path.
</p>

<p>
Billy stared at the old man; then his face broke into a
grin.  "O Gee!" he sighed, and sinking on a log, closed
his eyes.  "O Gee!" he repeated&mdash;leaping to his feet
and throwing his arms about the neck of the bay and
yelling into that animal's twitching ear.  "Hear that, you
Thomas?  They're married, Erie an' Teacher Stanhope's
married!"
</p>

<p>
"Billy, is ut clane crazy ye've gone?" chided the old
man, "that ye'd be afther deafenin' the poor steed wid
yer yellin'?  Listen now, fer ut's more I'll be tellin' ye."
</p>

<p>
Billy kicked his hat high in air and turned a
handspring.  "Tell me all about it, Harry.  You saw 'em
married, did you?"
</p>

<p>
"Faith and I did," cried Harry.  "And play 'em a
weddin' march on me whistle I did, soft as a spring rain
and swate as the very joy they do be feelin' this day.
A king he looked, Billy, and his bride a quane, ivery inch
av her.  But no more av your questions now," he broke
off, "fer step along I must, singin' me thankfulness from
me whistle, and spakin' the good tidings to them I mate
along the way."
</p>

<p>
Billy watched the old man move down the path, the
wild strains of the Irish tune he was playing falling on
his ears long after the player had been swallowed up in
the golden haze.  Then he too passed on, bay Thomas
walking sedately behind.  As he rounded a bend he met
Maurice Keeler and Jim Scroggie, heads close together and
speaking animatedly.
</p>

<p>
"Ho, Bill!" cried Maurice.  "Bringin' bay Thomas
up to the stable fer winter, eh?  Gee!  Jim, look at that
horse; did you ever see such a change in anythin' in your
life?"
</p>

<p>
"Thomas has sure fattened up," grinned Jim.  "I
guess it would puzzle old Johnston to know our horse now,
eh, Bill?"
</p>

<p>
"You mean your horse, Jim," corrected Billy.
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't either; he's only a third mine.  One third's
yours and the other third's Maurice's."
</p>

<p>
Maurice and Billy stared at him.  "It was your money
paid fer him," Billy asserted.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what of it?  Maurice found him a soft hidin'
place and good pasture on his Dad's farm, didn't he?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure, but then&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And it's you who's gain' to see that he gets cared for
all winter, ain't it?"
</p>

<p>
"You bet it is," cried Billy.
</p>

<p>
"Well then, I claim he's a company horse an' you an'
me an' Maurice is that company.  Now, that's settled, let
me tell you what Maurice and me was talkin' about when
you met us."
</p>

<p>
Billy unsnapped the tie-strap from Thomas' halter so
that he might crop the wayside grass without hindrance
and sat down on a log opposite the one occupied by his
friends.
</p>

<p>
Jim nudged Maurice but Maurice shook his head.
"You tell him," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Bill," Jim cried eagerly.  "I got a bit of news for
you that'll make you want to stand on your head and kick
splinters off the trees."
</p>

<p>
Billy grinned.  "An' I got a piece of news fer you
fellers, too," he returned.  "But go on, your news first,
Jim."
</p>

<p>
"Teacher Stanhope has made over a deed of Lost Man's
Swamp to you, Bill," said Jim.  "I heard Dad telling
Mr. Hinter all about it.  Dad was there when Lawyer
Maddoc drew up the deed&mdash;Maurice, you crazy hyena,
will you keep quiet?"
</p>

<p>
Maurice had rolled backward off the log, the while he
emitted cries that would have done a scalp-hunting Indian
credit.  "Three cheers fer Bill!" he yelled.  "He
discovered Lost Man's Swamp oil field.  Trigger Finger Tim
ain't got nuthin' on our Bill."
</p>

<p>
Billy was standing up now, his perplexed face turned
questioningly on his chums.
</p>

<p>
"That's right, Bill," cried Jim.  "You really did
discover it, you know.  Hinter said he was the only one who
knew the oil was there until you rafted out to the ponds
and saw the oil-bubbles breakin' on 'em.  He says that a
fortune likely lies there, so you see&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"An' Teacher Stanhope, he deeded the swamp to me,"
said Billy dazedly.  He got up from the log and squared
his shoulders.  "Well," he spoke, "that was mighty good
of him, but I ain't wantin' that swamp."
</p>

<p>
"But Bill," urged Jim, "the oil they've found there'll
make you rich."
</p>

<p>
Billy shook his head.  "I'm as rich as I ever want'a be
right now, Jim."
</p>

<p>
"Look here, Bill," cried Maurice.  "You don't want'a
hurt Teacher Stanhope's feelin's, do you!"
</p>

<p>
Billy glanced at him quickly, a troubled look in his
eyes.  "N-no," he said, "you bet I don't."
</p>

<p>
"Then that's all there is to it; you keep Lost Man,
that's what you do."
</p>

<p>
Billy considered.  "I ain't sayin' jest what I'll do," he
spoke finally.  "I gotta ask another person's advice on
this thing.  But if I do take it you, Jim, an' you, Maurice,
are goin' to be my partners in Lost Man same's you are
in bay Thomas.  Here, Maurice, you take Thomas to our
stable an' give him a feed.  I gotta go somewhere else."  And
leaving Jim and Maurice sitting, open-mouthed, Billy
ducked into the timber.
</p>

<p>
Not until he had put some distance between himself and
hia friends did he remember that he had not told them the
great and wonderful news that had been imparted to him
by old Harry.  Well, never mind, they would hear it soon.
Harry would see to that.  He turned into a path that
strayed far up among clumps of red-gold maples and
ochre-stained oaks.  The whistle of quail sounded from a ridge
of brown sumachs.  Up the hill, across the deep valley,
where wintergreen berries gleamed like drops of blood
among the mosses, he passed slowly and on to the
beech-crowned ridge.
</p>

<p>
Here he paused and his searching eyes sought the lower
sweep of woodland.  A clump of tall poplars gleamed
silvery-white against the dark green of the beeches; far
down at the end of the sweep the yellow tops of hardy
willows stood silhouetted against the undying green of
massed cedars and pines.  Billy gazed down upon it all
and his heart swelled with the deep joy of life, his nerves
tingled to the tang of the woodland scents.  Something
deep, stirring, mysterious, had come to him.  He did not
know what that something was&mdash;it was too vague and
incomprehensible for definition just yet.
</p>

<p>
His arm about the trunk of a tree, he laughed softly,
as his eyes, sweeping the checker-board of autumn's
glories, rested at last on the grove of coniferous trees.
So that was the haunted grove?  That dark, silent, spicy
bit of isolated loneliness far below was the spot he had so
feared!  But he feared it no longer.  <i>She</i> had cured him
of that.  <i>She</i> had said that fear of the supernatural was
foolish; and of course she was right.
</p>

<p>
A fat red-squirrel frisked down a tree close beside hia
and halted, pop-eyed, to gaze upon him.  "I tell you,"
Billy addressed it gravely, "it takes a good woman to
steady a man."  The statement was not of his own creation.
He had heard it somewhere but he had never understood
its meaning before.  It seemed the fitting thing to
say now and there was nobody to say it to except the
squirrel.
</p>

<p>
A blue-jay and a yellow-hammer flashed by him, side by
side, racing for the grubbing-fields of the soft woods
below, their blue and yellow bodies marking twin streaks
against the hazy light.  Blue and yellow, truly the most
wonderful colors of all the colorful world, thought Billy.
The scene faded and in its place grew up a face with
blue, laughing eyes and red, smiling lips, above which
gleamed a halo of spun gold.  Then the woodland picture
swam back before him and the squirrel, which with the
characteristic patience of its kind had waited to watch this
boy who often threw it a nut-kernel, called after him
chidingly as he dipped down into the valley.
</p>

<p>
Billy was still thinking of the only girl when he topped
the farther ridge and descended into the valley where
stood the haunted grove.  He wondered what she would
say when he told her the great news he had to tell her.  He
thought he knew.  She would put her hand on his arm
and say: "Billy, I'm glad."  Well, he was on his way to
hear her say it.  As he entered a clump of cedars he saw
her.  She wore a cloak of crimson; her hat had slipped to
her shoulders and her hair glowed softly through the
shadowy half lights.  She stood beside old man Scroggie's
grave, a great bunch of golden-rod in her arms.
</p>

<p>
Billy called and she turned to him with a smile.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'm so glad you came, Billy," she said.  "You
can help me decorate uncle's grave."
</p>

<p>
She dropped the yellow blossoms on the mound and they
went out into the sunshine together and gathered more.
When they had finished the task they went across to the
weedy plot in which stood the tumble-down hut.  There,
seated side by side beneath a gnarled wild-apple tree, Billy
told her all he had to tell her, and heard her say, just as
he knew she would say, "Billy, I'm glad."
</p>

<p>
Then between them fell silence, filled with understanding
and contentment and thoughts that ran parallel the
same long track through future promise.  Billy spoke, at
length: "He's goin' to take the school ag'in.  An' him
an' me are goin' to build that sail-boat we've always
wanted&mdash;a big broad-beamed, single sticker that'll carry all of
us&mdash;you, me, teacher, Erie an' anybody wants to come
along.  Gee! ain't it great?"
</p>

<p>
The girl nodded.  "And what will you name her?" she
asked.  Into Billy's cheeks the blood sprang as into his
heart joy ran riot.
</p>

<p>
"I aim to call her <i>Lou</i>," he said hesitatingly.  "That
is if you don't mind."
</p>

<p>
The golden head was bowed and when it was raised to
him, he saw a deeper color in the cheeks, a softer glow in
the eyes.  "Come," she said softly, "we must be getting
back."
</p>

<p>
They crossed the sunflecked grass, hand in hand.  As
they reached the pine grove the girl pointed away above
the trees.  "Look," she whispered.
</p>

<p>
Billy's gaze followed hers.  High above the trees a black
speck came speeding toward them, a speck which grew
quickly into a bird, a big, black bird, who knew, apparently,
just where he was going.
</p>

<p>
"It's Croaker," Billy whispered.  "Stand right still,
Lou, an' we'll watch an' find out what his game is."
</p>

<p>
He drew her a little further among the pines and they
peered out to see Croaker alight on the broken-backed ridge
pole of the log hut.
</p>

<p>
Here, with many low croaks, he proceeded to search his
surroundings with quick, suspicious eyes, straining
forward to peer closely at scrub or bush, then cunningly
twisting about suddenly as though hoping to take some
skulking watcher behind him unawares.
</p>

<p>
Finally he seemed satisfied that he was alone.  His harsh
notes became soft guttural cooes.  He nodded his big head
up and down in grave satisfaction, tip-toeing from one end
of the ridge-pole to the other and chuckling softly to
himself.  Then suddenly, he vanished from sight.
</p>

<p>
"Where has he gone?" whispered Lou.
</p>

<p>
"Hush," warned Billy.  His heart was pounding.
</p>

<p>
The watchers stood with eyes glued to the ridge-pole.
By and by they saw a black tail-feather obtrude itself from
a hole just beneath the roof's gable.  A black body
followed and Croaker came tiptoeing back along the ridge.
</p>

<p>
The girl felt her companion's hand tighten spasmodically
on hers.  She glanced up to find him staring, wide-eyed
at the bird.
</p>

<p>
"Billy!" she whispered, almost forgetting caution in
her anxiety.  "What is it?"
</p>

<p>
He pointed a shaking finger at Croaker.  "See that
shiny thing that old rogue has in his bill, Lou!" he asked.
"What do you 'spose that is?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, what is it?"
</p>

<p>
"It's one of the gold pieces your uncle hid away.  Come
on, now we'll see that Croaker throw a fit."
</p>

<p>
They stepped out into plain view of the crow, who was
muttering to the gold-piece which he now held before his
eyes in one black claw.  Croaker lowered his head and
twisted it from side to side in sheer wonder.  He could
scarcely believe his eyes.  Then as Billy stepped forward
and called him by name his black neck-ruff arose in anger
and, dropping his prized bit of gold, he poured out such a
torrent of abuse upon the boy and girl that Lou put her
fingers in her ears to stop the sound.
</p>

<p>
"He's awful mad," grinned Billy.  "He's been keepin'
this find to himself fer a long time."  At sound of his
master's voice Croaker paused in his harangue and
promptly changed his tactics.  He swooped down to Billy's
shoulder and rubbed the top of his glossy head against the
boy's cheek, whispering low and lying terms of endearment.
</p>

<p>
Lou laughed, "What's he up to now, Billy?"
</p>

<p>
"He's tryin' to coax me away from his treasure," Billy
answered.  "Now, jest watch him."
</p>

<p>
"What you want'a do, Croaker?" he asked, stroking
the bird's neck feathers smooth.
</p>

<p>
"Kawak!" said Croaker, and jumping to the ground
he started away, head twisted backward toward the boy and
girl, coaxing sounds pouring from his half open beak.
</p>

<p>
"No, sir," cried Billy.  "You don't fool me ag'in.  I'm
goin' to climb up there an' see jest how much gold is hid
in that hole under the gable."
</p>

<p>
Croaker watched him reach for a chink in the logs and
raise himself toward the treasure house.  Then he became
silent and sat huddled up, wings drooping discontentedly,
his whole aspect one of utter despair.
</p>

<p>
Lou, bending to caress him, heard Billy give an exclamation,
and ran forward.  "It's here, Lou," he cried excitedly,
"a tin box an' a shot-bag full of gold in a hollered-out
log.  The bag has been ripped open by Croaker.  I'll
have to go inside to get the box out."
</p>

<p>
He dropped to the sward and stepped through an
unglazed window into the hut.  Nailed to one end was a
crude ladder.  Billy climbed the ladder and peered closely
at the log which held the money.  To all appearances it
was exactly like its fellows, no door, no latch to be seen.
And still, he reasoned, there must be an opening of some
kind there.  He lit a match and held it close to the log.
Then he whistled.  What he had mistaken for a pine knot
was a small button fixed, as he saw now, in a tiny groove.
He moved the button and a small section of the log fell,
spraying him with musty dust.
</p>

<p>
Another moment and he was outside beside Lou, bag
and box in his arms.  Croaker was nowhere to be seen;
neither was the gold piece which he had dropped in his
amazement at sight of Billy and Lou.
</p>

<p>
"He went back and got it," said the girl, in answer
to Billy's look of amazement.  "And, Billy, he flew away
in an awful grouch."

<p>
"Oh, he'll soon get over it," laughed Billy.  "We'll
find him waitin' fer us farther on."
</p>

<p>
They crossed the lot and went through the pines to the
sunny open.  There, on a mossy knoll, Lou spread her cloak,
and Billy poured the gold from bag and box upon it.
</p>

<p>
Lou started to count the money.  Billy sat back,
watching her.  "Yes, sir," he mused, "it certainly takes a
good woman to steady a man."  For ten glorious minutes
he built air castles and dreamed dreams.
</p>

<p>
"Two thousand nine hundred and forty dollars," Low
announced, and Billy jumped up.
</p>

<p>
"Whew!" he whistled, "an' all gold, too.  The three
pieces that Croaker took make the even three thousand."
</p>

<p>
They placed the money back in the box and bag.  Then
Billy, picking up the treasure, spoke gently.
</p>

<p>
"It'll make 'em a grand weddin' gift, Lou."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she answered, "a grand wedding gift, Billy."
</p>

<p>
In silence they passed on through the upland gowned
in hazy, golden spray.  At the height of land they paused
to look down across the sweeping country below them.
Then blue eyes sought grey and hand in hand, with a new
glad vista of life opening before them, they went on into
the valley.
